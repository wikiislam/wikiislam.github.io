</p><p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:1"> <sup>1</sup></span> Ta. Sin. Mim.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:2"> <sup>2</sup></span> These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:3"> <sup>3</sup></span> We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, for people who believe.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:4"> <sup>4</sup></span> Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections, depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew, but he kept alive their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:5"> <sup>5</sup></span> And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders (in Faith) and make them heirs,
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:6"> <sup>6</sup></span> To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman, and their hosts, at their hands, the very things against which they were taking precautions.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:7"> <sup>7</sup></span> So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: &quot;Suckle (thy child), but when thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Our apostles.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:8"> <sup>8</sup></span> Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended) that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were men of sin.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:9"> <sup>9</sup></span> The wife of Pharaoh said: &quot;(Here is) joy of the eye, for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us, or we may adopt him as a son.&quot; And they perceived not (what they were doing)!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:10"> <sup>10</sup></span> But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was going almost to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart (with faith), so that she might remain a (firm) believer.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:11"> <sup>11</sup></span> And she said to the sister of (Moses), &quot;Follow him&quot; so she (the sister) watched him in the character of a stranger. And they knew not.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:12"> <sup>12</sup></span> And we ordained that he refused suck at first, until (His sister came up and) said: &quot;Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?&quot;...
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:13"> <sup>13</sup></span> Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true: but most of them do not understand.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:15"> <sup>15</sup></span> And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and he found there two men fighting,- one of his own religion, and the other, of his foes. Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe, and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end of him. He said: &quot;This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly misleads!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:16"> <sup>16</sup></span> He prayed: &quot;O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive me!&quot; So ((Allah)) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:17"> <sup>17</sup></span> He said: &quot;O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never shall I be a help to those who sin!&quot;

Moses said to him: &quot;Thou art truly, it is clear, a quarrelsome fellow!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:19"> <sup>19</sup></span> Then, when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of them, that man said: &quot;O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest a man yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful violent man in the land, and not to be one who sets things right!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:20"> <sup>20</sup></span> And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the City. He said: &quot;O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to slay thee: so get thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:21"> <sup>21</sup></span> He therefore got away therefrom, looking about, in a state of fear. He prayed &quot;O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:22"> <sup>22</sup></span> Then, when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan, he said: &quot;I do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:23"> <sup>23</sup></span> And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks), and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: &quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; They said: &quot;We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): And our father is a very old man.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:24"> <sup>24</sup></span> So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade, and said:&quot;O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou dost send me!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:25"> <sup>25</sup></span> Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him, walking bashfully. She said: &quot;My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered (our flocks) for us.&quot; So when he came to him and narrated the story, he said: &quot;Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:26"> <sup>26</sup></span> Said one of the (damsels): &quot;O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty&quot;....
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:27"> <sup>27</sup></span> He said: &quot;I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on condition that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years, it will be (grace) from thee. But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me, indeed, if Allah wills, one of the righteous.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:28"> <sup>28</sup></span> He said: &quot;Be that (the agreement) between me and thee: whichever of the two terms I fulfil, let there be no ill-will to me. Be Allah a witness to what we say.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:29"> <sup>29</sup></span> Now when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:30"> <sup>30</sup></span> But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground: &quot;O Moses! Verily I am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds....
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:31"> <sup>31</sup></span> &quot;Now do thou throw thy rod!&quot; but when he saw it moving (of its own accord) as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: O Moses!&quot; (It was said), &quot;Draw near, and fear not: for thou art of those who are secure.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:32"> <sup>32</sup></span> &quot;Move thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm), and draw thy hand close to thy side (to guard) against fear.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:33"> <sup>33</sup></span> He said: &quot;O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear lest they slay me.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:35"> <sup>35</sup></span> He said: &quot;We will certainly strengthen thy arm through thy brother, and invest you both with authority, so they shall not be able to touch you: with Our Sign shall ye triumph,- you two as well as those who follow you.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:36"> <sup>36</sup></span> When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said: &quot;This is nothing but sorcery faked up: never did we head the like among our fathers of old!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:37"> <sup>37</sup></span> Moses said: &quot;My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:38"> <sup>38</sup></span> Pharaoh said: &quot;O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore, O Haman! light me a (kiln to bake bricks) out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the god of Moses: but as far as I am concerned, I think (Moses) is a liar!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:39"> <sup>39</sup></span> And he was arrogant and insolent in the land, beyond reason,- He and his hosts: they thought that they would not have to return to Us!

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="28:48"> <sup>48</sup></span> But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, &quot;Why are not (Signs) sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses?&quot; Do they not then reject (the Signs) which were formerly sent to Moses?
