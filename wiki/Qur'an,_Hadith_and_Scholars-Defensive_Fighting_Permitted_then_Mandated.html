<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Defensive_Fighting_Permitted">Defensive Fighting Permitted</span></h2>
<p>These verses call on Muslims to defend themselves if they are attacked, but they do not require Muslims to defend themselves.
</p><p>Several months after the Muslims' arrival in Medina, the Muslims started to raid the caravans of the Meccan traders who passed near their area. These Muslim raids would eventually cause the Meccans to attack the Muslims in defense of their caravans; with the first Meccan attack, known as the Battle of Badr, occurring in 624. 
</p><p>It was at this time that Muhammad gave permission to the Muslims to defend themselves by fighting and killing the idol worshiping Meccans. These new verses abrogated the <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Pacifism_Promoted.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Pacifism Promoted">previous non-aggressive verses</a> that were revealed by Muhammad.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Qur.27an">Qur'an</span></h3>
<p>Permission is given to Muslims to go to war in order to defend themselves.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>To those against whom war is made, permission is given (to fight), because they are wronged;- and verily, Allah is most powerful for their aid;-<br><br>
(They are) those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right,- (for no cause) except that they say, &quot;our Lord is Allah&quot;. Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure. Allah will certainly aid those who aid his (cause);- for verily Allah is full of Strength, Exalted in Might, (able to enforce His Will).<br><br>
</p>
(They are) those who, if We establish them in the land, establish regular prayer and give regular charity, enjoin the right and forbid wrong: with Allah rests the end (and decision) of (all) affairs.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/022-qmt.php#022.039#022.039">22:39-41</a> </div></div>
<p>Allah will reward those Muslims who die while waging Jihad.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah, and are then slain or die,- On them will Allah bestow verily a goodly Provision: Truly Allah is He Who bestows the best provision.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/022-qmt.php#022.058#022.058">22:58</a></div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Defensive_Fighting_Mandated">Defensive Fighting Mandated</span></h2>
<p>These Islamic texts mandate that Muslims defend themselves if they or their fellow Muslims are being attacked.
</p><p>A few months after Muhammad gave permission to the Muslims to defend themselves from attacks, Muhammad made defensive fighting obligatory for all able Muslims. These verses abrogated the previous verses that only gave permission, but did not mandate, that Muslims are to fight in self defense; new commands which themselves would later be abrogated by even newer commands that ordered <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Offensive_Fighting_Mandated.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Offensive Fighting Mandated">Muslims to attack and subdue</a> all non-Muslims (<a href="wiki/Kafir.html" title="Kafir">Kuffar</a>).
</p><p>At this stage Muhammad did not consider the Jews to be his enemies since he was still expecting them to embrace him as their prophet, but the Jews who did not accept him as a prophet would later become Muhammad's enemies. Starting with the Battle of Uhud the hypocrites, who were Muslim only in name and who did not actually believe in Muhammad, started becoming Muhammad's enemies.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Qur.27an_2">Qur'an</span></h3>
<p>Forgive and overlook unbelieving Jews.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Quite a number of the People of the Book wish they could Turn you (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed, from selfish envy, after the Truth hath become Manifest unto them: But forgive and overlook, Till Allah accomplish His purpose; for Allah Hath power over all things. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.109#002.109">2:109</a></div></div>
<p>If attacked then Muslims are to fight against their attackers until the attackers desist from fighting, stop persecuting Muslims and Islam to be established.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors. <br><br>
And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have Turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.<br><br>
But if they cease, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. <br><br>
And fight them on until there is no more Tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression.<br><br>
</p>
The prohibited month for the prohibited month,- and so for all things prohibited,- there is the law of equality. If then any one transgresses the prohibition against you, Transgress ye likewise against him. But fear Allah, and know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.190#002.190">2:190-194</a> </div></div>
<p>Defensive fighting against attacking Arab Meccans is now obligatory, but during Zul-Hajj it's an offense.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p><b>Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you.</b> Allah knoweth, ye know not.<br><br>
They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein.<br><br>
</p>
Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate (to escape the persecution) and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah's mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.216#002.216">2:216-218</a> </div></div>
<p>If you defeat your attackers then don't force them to convert to Islam, but if they don't convert to Islam then they shall be sent to hell.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.<br><br>
</p>
Allah is the Protector of those who have faith: from the depths of darkness He will lead them forth into light. Of those who reject faith the patrons are the evil ones: from light they will lead them forth into the depths of darkness. They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein (For ever).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.256#002.256">2:256-257</a> </div></div>
<p>The spoils of war that are captured after fighting the Arab Meccans belong to Allah and Muhammad.
</p>
<div class="quotes">They ask thee concerning (things taken as) spoils of war. Say: &quot;(such) spoils are at the disposal of Allah and the Messenger: So fear Allah, and keep straight the relations between yourselves: Obey Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/008-qmt.php#008.001#008.001">8:1</a></div></div>
<p>Cut the necks and finger-tips of those who contend against Allah and Muhammad and never turn your backs to them.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): &quot;I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.&quot;<br><br>
This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: If any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment.<br><br>
Thus (will it be said): &quot;Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist Allah, is the penalty of the Fire.&quot;<br><br>
O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them.<br><br>
If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop (of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed)!<br><br>
It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but Allah's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).<br><br>

<p>Fight the unbelievers until they stop fighting, they stop persecuting Muslims and they allow Islam to be established. A fifth of all war booty goes to Muhammad.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).<br><br>
And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.<br><br>
If they refuse, be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help.<br><br>
And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.<br><br>
</p>
Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley, and they on the farther side, and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet, ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But (thus ye met), that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted; that those who died might die after a clear Sign (had been given), and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign (had been given).

<p>If you defeat them in battle then treat those who are treacherous with treachery and terrorize them. Allah will repay what you have spent. If they ask for peace then give them peace.

<div class="quotes"> 
<p>If ye gain the mastery over them in war, disperse, with them, those who follow them, that they may remember.<br><br>
If thou fearest treachery from any group, throw back (their covenant) to them, (so as to be) on equal terms: for Allah loveth not the treacherous.<br><br>
Let not the unbelievers think that they can get the better (of the godly): they will never frustrate (them).<br><br>
Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom Allah doth know. Whatever ye shall spend in the cause of Allah, shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly.<br><br>

<p>Fight with patience and perseverance, because you shall eventually win. Kill the Arab Meccans and do not take any prisoners until the land is subdued. Muslims shouldn't fight to get material goods, but if they do then Allah will forgive their mistake this time.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers: for these are a people without understanding.<br><br>
For the present, Allah hath lightened your (task), for He knoweth that there is a weak spot in you: But (even so), if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred, and if a thousand, they will vanquish two thousand, with the leave of Allah: for Allah is with those who patiently persevere.<br><br>
It is not fitting for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war until he hath thoroughly subdued the land. Ye look for the temporal goods of this world; but Allah looketh to the Hereafter: And Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.<br><br>
Had it not been for a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe penalty would have reached you for the (ransom) that ye took.<br><br>

<p>Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.<br><br>

<p>Those who lagged behind (will say), when ye (are free to) march and take booty (in war): &quot;Permit us to follow you.&quot; They wish to change Allah's decree: Say: &quot;Not thus will ye follow us: Allah has already declared (this) beforehand&quot;: then they will say, &quot;But ye are jealous of us.&quot; Nay, but little do they understand (such things).<br><br>
Say to the desert Arabs who lagged behind: &quot;Ye shall be summoned (to fight) against a people given to vehement war: then shall ye fight, or they shall submit. Then if ye show obedience, Allah will grant you a goodly reward, but if ye turn back as ye did before, He will punish you with a grievous Penalty.&quot;<br><br>
</p>
No blame is there on the blind, nor is there blame on the lame, nor on one ill (if he joins not the war): But he that obeys Allah and his Messenger,- (Allah) will admit him to Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and he who turns back, (Allah) will punish him with a grievous Penalty.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/048-qmt.php#048.015#048.015">48:15-17</a> </div></div>
<p>Muslims attempted to enter Mecca to perform the pilgrimage in 628 A.D. but they were prevented from entering the city by the Meccan forces. There was no fighting between the Muslims and the Meccans and the Muslims and Meccans came to an agreement called the Treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah, which permitted the Muslims to perform their pilgrimage one year later in return for a 10 year truce.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>If the Unbelievers should fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper.<br><br>
(Such has been) the practice (approved) of Allah already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.<br><br>
</p>
And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka, after that He gave you the victory over them. And Allah sees well all that ye do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/048-qmt.php#048.022#048.022">48:22-24</a> </div></div>
<p>Muslims are strong against unbelievers, but they are compassionate to one another.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/048-qmt.php#048.029#048.029">48:29</a></div></div>
<p>Fight against the unbelievers and the hypocrites.
</p>
<div class="quotes">O Prophet! Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/066-qmt.php#066.009#066.009">66:9</a></div></div>
<p>The only true believers are those Muslims who believe in Allah and Muhammad, have never doubted, and who wage Jihad with all that they possess.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Only those are Believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and have never since doubted, but have striven with their belongings and their persons in the Cause of Allah: Such are the sincere ones.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/049-qmt.php#049.015#049.015">49:15</a></div></div>
