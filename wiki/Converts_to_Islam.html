<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Although terrorism is not exclusive to the Islamic ideology, it should be noted that a disproportionate number of terrorists are Muslims who are motivated by the <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Jihad.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Jihad">teachings of Islam</a>. Peter Neumann, a Professor of Security Studies at King’s College in London, has noted that Western converts were &quot;overrepresented among jihadists&quot;,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Converts_to_Islam.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and a 2011 study found that 55% of <a href="wiki/United_States.html" title="United States">US</a> born Muslims arrested for Islamic terrorist activities were converts to Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Converts_to_Islam.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Those who were born into Islam may be ignorant of their religion and its actual teachings, therefore they are Muslims who are most likely to interpret Islam in a peaceful way. However, many converts to Islam are more zealous; learning as much about their new found faith as they can. When they do that, the only conclusion that they can draw is that Islam's <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">deity</a> endorses terrorism and <a href="wiki/72_Virgins.html" title="72 Virgins">rewards terrorists</a>. 
</p><p>If someone is involved in crime and terrorism and they had converted to a certain faith system, it is almost always Islam that the person converted to. The hate for non-Muslims found in Islam is quickly picked up by them. As a result, these converts often turn to the practice or support of terrorism and violence; often showing hatred for <a href="wiki/Friendship_of_Non-Muslims.html" title="Friendship of Non-Muslims">their own family</a>, country,  and former way of life.
