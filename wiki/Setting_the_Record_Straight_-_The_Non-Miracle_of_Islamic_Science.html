<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> <a href="wiki/Golden_Age.html" title="Golden Age">Golden Age</a> lasted from 750 AD to at least the mid-11<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> century, when Al Ghazali managed to successfully argue for faith over reason; some say until the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258 AD. It was largely coincident with the Abbasid Empire and produced some great Muslim scientists. However, some <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> have overstated the achievements of these Muslim scientists, downgraded the achievements of non-Muslim scientists, or appropriated for Muslims the achievements of others. Some even claim the Golden Age ended in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. However, extending the Golden Age by another two centuries is non-factual because even before the year 1258, the Abbasid empire was decaying and crumbling.
</p><p>The purpose of this analysis is to put the achievements of Golden Age Muslim scientists in the proper perspective, neither denigrating their achievements nor inflating them. All scientific and technological progress is accomplished in progression; Muslim achievements are but links in the chain. Few of the great Muslim scientific achievements stood alone, but were derived by Muslim scientists standing on the shoulders of those who came before them. Also, by transmitting Greek, Roman, Hindu, Persian and Egyptian knowledge (<i>some</i> of which<i> may</i> have been lost were it not for these <a href="wiki/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> translations), these Muslim scientists did humanity a great service. 
</p><p>While we do not take issue with the Muslim scientists, some of whom are acknowledged greats, we do think the lack of follow-up progress is a severe indictment of Islam. For instance, Newton (a non-Muslim scientist who was ranked as the second <a href="wiki/Muhammad_and_Historys_100_Most_Influential_People.html" title="Muhammad and Historys 100 Most Influential People">most influential person in history</a>, by Michael H. Hart) and his work on optics lead to the invention of the telescope and microscope, and contributed to great strides in astronomy, geography, and microbiology. In contrast, Alhazen’s work on optics led to no new scientific breakthroughs. 
</p><p>Most occasions, the initial discovery (basic science) is not enough to create technological progress, the basic discovery has to be followed by applied science, which the Muslim scientists largely failed to do. For instance, Sir Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin, but it also took Sir Howard Florey and Ernst Chain to develop a way to produce the antibiotic in therapeutic quantities. The Islamic Golden Age was mostly lacking in such scientific ‘follow-ups’ and allowed the works of their great scientists to wither on the vine or die stillborn.

<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> Until the 14th century, the only type of clock available was the water clock. In 1335, a large mechanical clock was erected in Milan, Italy. This was possibly the first weight-driven clock.<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> A variety of mechanical clocks were produced by Spanish Muslim engineers, both large and small, and this knowledge was transmitted to Europe through Latin translations of Islamic books on mechanics. These clocks were weight-driven. Designs and illustrations of epi-cyclic and segmental gears were provided. One such clock included a mercury escapement. The latter type was directly copied by Europeans during the 15th century. In addition, during the 9th century, Ibn Firnas of Islamic Spain, according to Will Durant, invented a watch-like device which kept accurate time. The Muslims also constructed a variety of highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their observatories.<sup id="cite_ref-Dr_K._Ajram_1-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-Dr_K._Ajram-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pendulum">Pendulum</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> In the 17th century, the pendulum was developed by Galileo during his teenage years. He noticed a chandelier swaying as it was being blown by the wind. As a result, he went home and invented the pendulum.<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> The pendulum was discovered by Ibn Yunus al-Masri during the 10th century, who was the first to study and document its oscillatory motion.

<p>The Romans were aware of pendulums as they used pendulums for scrying, and their methods were detailed in the writings of Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The first authenticated pendulum clock was built by Christian Huygens in 1657 although Galileo had thought about it around 1602.

<p>The Chinese invented movable type printing. In 1041, a Chinese named, Pi-Sheng, developed type characters from hardened clay but was not totally successful. In the early 1200, Korea invented type characters cast from metal (bronze). The oldest extant metal type printing is ‘Baegun Hwasang Chorok Buljo jikji simche yojeol,’ abbreviated to ‘Jikji,’ which was published in 1377 Cheungju, Korea and is currently kept in the National Library of France.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> Isaac Newton's 17th century study of lenses, light and prisms forms the foundation of the modern science of optics.<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> In the 1lth century al-Haytham determined virtually everything that Newton advanced regarding optics centuries prior and is regarded by numerous authorities as the &quot;founder of optics. &quot; There is little doubt that Newton was influenced by him.

<p>Chalk one up for the apologists. Alhazen was a great scientist.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nature_of_Matter">Nature of Matter</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> The concept of the finite nature of matter was first introduced by Antione Lavoisier during the 18th century. He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same. Thus, for instance, if water is heated to steam, if salt is dissolved in water or if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged.<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> The principles of this discovery were elaborated centuries before by Islamic Persia's great scholar, al-Biruni (d. 1050).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Surgery">Surgery</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> In 1545, the scientific use of surgery was advanced by the French surgeon Ambroise Pare. Prior to him, surgeons attempted to stop bleeding through the gruesome procedure of searing the wound with boiling oil. Pare stopped the use of boiling oils and began ligating arteries. He is considered the &quot;father of rational surgery.&quot; Pare was also one of the first Europeans to condemn such grotesque &quot;surgical&quot; procedures as trepanning (see reference #6, pg. 110).<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> Islamic Spain's illustrious surgeon, az-Zahrawi (d. 1013), began ligating arteries with fine sutures over 500 years prior to Pare. He perfected the use of Catgut, that is suture made from animal intestines. Additionally, he instituted the use of cotton plus wax to plug bleeding wounds. The full details of his works were made available to Europeans through Latin translations. 
<p>Despite this, barbers and herdsmen continued be the primary individuals practicing the &quot;art&quot; of surgery for nearly six centuries after az-Zahrawi's death. Pare himself was a barber, albeit more skilled and conscientious than the average ones. 
</p>
Included in az-Zahrawi's legacy are dozens of books. His most famous work is a 30 volume treatise on medicine and surgery. His books contain sections on preventive medicine, nutrition, cosmetics, drug therapy, surgical technique, anesthesia, pre and post-operative care as well as drawings of some 200 surgical devices, many of which he invented. The refined and scholarly az-Zahrawi must be regarded as the father and founder of rational surgery, not the uneducated Pare.<sup id="cite_ref-Dr_K._Ajram_1-34" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-Dr_K._Ajram-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Medical_Theories">Medical Theories</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> The discovery of the scientific use of drugs in the treatment of specific diseases was made by Paracelsus, the Swiss-born physician, during the 16th century. He is also credited with being the first to use practical experience as a determining factor in the treatment of patients rather than relying exclusively on the works of the ancients.<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> Ar-Razi, Ibn Sina, al-Kindi, Ibn Rushd, az-Zahrawi, Ibn Zuhr, Ibn Baytar, Ibn al-Jazzar, Ibn Juljul, Ibn al-Quff, Ibn an-Nafs, al-Biruni, Ibn Sahl and hundreds of other Muslim physicians mastered the science of drug therapy for the treatment of specific symptoms and diseases. In fact, this concept was entirely their invention. The word &quot;drug&quot; is derived from Arabic. Their use of practical experience and careful observation was extensive. 
Muslim physicians were the first to criticize ancient medical theories and practices. Ar-Razi devoted an entire book as a critique of Galen's anatomy. The works of Paracelsus are insignificant compared to the vast volumes of medical writings and original findings accomplished by the medical giants of Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-Dr_K._Ajram_1-37" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-Dr_K._Ajram-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>The Muslim physicians listed above made great contributions to medical science. For many centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Arabic world was the center of scientific and medical knowledge. Texts from Greece and Rome were translated into Arabic and studied by Islamic scholars. They developed and refined Hippocrate's theories and Islamic physicians began to use the regulation of diet, exercise and the prescription of medicinal herbs in the treatment of their patients. Arabic pharmacists became skilled in the formulation of medicines from plants and minerals. 
</p><p>One of the most important medical books of its time was written by the physician Ali al-Husayn Abd Allah Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna). His massive manuscript, called the Laws of Medicine, was completed around 1030 AD and translated into Latin in the 12<sup>th</sup> Century. This encyclopaedia of medicine contained five books detailing the formulation of medicines, diagnosis of disorders, general medicine and detailed therapies. It continued to be a great influence in the development of medicine in medieval Europe for hundreds of years.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, it must be noted that the Muslim physicians <i>did not</i> invent medicine. They owed a great debt to two Christians in the court of the Caliph Mamun; Yahya ibn Masawayh and his student, Hunain ibn Ishaq who translated Greek medical texts and laid the foundations of Arab medicine.

<div class="quotes"><b>What is Taught:</b> Medical treatment for the insane was modernized by Philippe Pinel when in 1793 he operated France's first insane asylum.<br><br><b>What Should be Taught:</b> As early as the 1lth century, Islamic hospitals maintained special wards for the insane. They treated them kindly and presumed their disease was real at a time when the insane were routinely burned alive in Europe as witches and sorcerers. A curative approach was taken for mental illness and, for the first time in history, the mentally ill were treated with supportive care, drugs and psychotherapy. Every major Islamic city maintained an insane asylum where patients were treated at no charge. In fact, the Islamic system for the treatment of the insane excels in comparison to the current model, as it was more humane and was highly effective as well.<sup id="cite_ref-Dr_K._Ajram_1-39" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-Dr_K._Ajram-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>There is evidence that the institution of the hospital, including the wards for the insane, was inherited by the Muslims from both the Persians and the Byzantines. Already before the rise of Islam, the hospital at Jundhapur, near the present Persian city of Ahvaz, was a major medical institution which, in addition to the care of patients, medical instruction was carried out on an extensive basis. There were also hospitals established by Byzantines in their eastern provinces such as <a href="wiki/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> which became rapidly integrated into the Islamic world.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>
</p><p>The hospital was first introduced into Islamic societies in the reign of the sixth Ummayid caliph, Al-Walid Bin Abdul-Malik (705 - 715 AD) in Jundishapur, a Persian city in the province of Ahwaz.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>
</p><p>The early Islamic hospital, the bimaristan, was &quot;an institution built by Muslim caliphs, sultans and kings and by benevolent persons in general, as an act of charity, such as mosques and hospices. Its function was not restricted to the treatment of the ill; it also served as a place for instruction in the sciences and medicine from which students would graduate much as they do from our modern medical schools today.&quot; The term “maristan” is a later abbreviation of the original Persian, bimaristan, meaning &quot;house of the ill.&quot; 
</p><p>The commonly held view which prevails to this day was that the bimaristan was an asylum for the insane. This misconception derives from the abbreviation of one of the institution's functions. &quot;Bimaristans were public hospitals for the treatment of all illnesses, whether those requiring surgery or medication, whether physical or mental. With the passage of time, however, these institutions fell into disrepair and were abandoned by all their patients with the exception of the mentally ill. As a result, in recent times the term, if used at all, refers only to a madhouse.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The real purpose of this article was to re-balance some of these flawed views readers may encounter on other websites and forums which use the works (or derivations thereof) of Dr. K. Ajram. We do think the Muslim scientists in the Golden Age (whether true adherents of Islam or not) did make substantial strides in science and technology, which resulted in a significant contribution to the sum of human knowledge. Scientific accomplishments are often the culmination of accumulated knowledge, rather than lone &quot;miraculous&quot; discoveries by individuals because of their religious and cultural settings. It is a matter of public record that the western scientists who came after the scientists of the Golden Age, e.g. Roger Bacon and Sir Isaac Newton, were aware of their works and also learned from them. However, an analysis of the apologetic claims about their greatness shows some exaggeration. In his haste to exaggerate, Ajram appears to have maligned the contribution of other cultures, downgraded the greatness of non-Muslim scientists, or misappropriated their works. 
</p><p>This analysis also highlights the biggest flaw of the Islamic Golden Age. There were few ‘follow-up’ breakthroughs on the backs of the works of the great Muslim scientists. In effect, the Ummah allowed or encouraged these works to wither on the vine or die stillborn, even before the rise of mysticism at the expense of rational thinking, an event often attributed to al-Ghazzali around the turn of the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Therefore, Islam is not the cause of scientific progress during the Golden Age. Many people would say that the Golden Age scientific progress was made in spite of Islam, not because of it. 
</p><p>A prime example is the great philosopher-physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna) whose  work is constantly referenced by Ajram. It is true that Ibn Sina was one of the most influential medieval philosophers, but he was also one of the most frequently attacked. The Sunni Theologians opposed his ideas on the soul and creation. However, it was the aforementioned Algazali (Abu Hamid ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali, 1058 - 1111 AD) who was his chief opponent. In &quot;The Incoherence of Philosophers&quot;, al-Ghazzali attacked Ibn Sina's Neoplatonic tendency to reject Allah's power over the events of the world, his disbelief in bodily resurrection, and his belief that Allah only knew the world of universals, (i.e. dog, tree, rational animality) not the individual self. He even used pig products in his scientific endeavours, <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Setting_the_Record_Straight_-_The_Non-Miracle_of_Islamic_Science.html#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> something that is certainly not in-line with pious Muslim behavior.

Beyond question the poet-astronomer was undevout; and his astronomy doubtless helped to make him so. One contemporary writes: &quot;I did not observe that he had any great belief in astrological predictions; nor have I seen or heard of any of the great (scientists) who had such belief.&quot; In point of fact he was not, any more than Abu';-Ala, a convinced atheist, but he had no sympathy with popular religion. &quot;He gave his adherence to no religious sect.
