<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Kalima">Kalima</span></h2>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muslim_Claim:_.27Isa_is_the_word_.22Be.22">Muslim Claim: 'Isa is the word &quot;Be&quot;</span></h3>
<p>When Muslims are confronted with the verse describing <a href="wiki/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Christ Jesus</a> as Allah's Word, they frequently try to explain it by saying he is the word &quot;Be.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Allah,_His_Word,_and_'Isa.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Allah,_His_Word,_and_'Isa.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tafsir_Ibn_Kathir">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</span></h4>
<div class="quotes"><i>Al-Masih `Isa, son of Maryam, was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from [created by] Him;</i> `Isa is only one of Allah's servants and one of His creatures. Allah said to him, `Be', and he was, and He sent him as a Messenger. `Isa was a word from Allah that He bestowed on Maryam, meaning He created him with the word `Be' that He sent with Jibril to Maryam.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12951?sid=4&tid=12951">Tafsir Ibn Kathir - Prohibiting the People of the Book From Going to Extremes in Religion</a></div></div>
<p>Allah said that Jesus is Allah's Word and a spirit from Allah--although notice how Ibn Kathir added that &quot;created by&quot; in there?  However, if we examine Ibn Kathir's explanation, you'll notice that it looks like 'Isa was already in existence.  How could Allah say TO HIM, &quot;Be,&quot; if he didn't exist yet?  Ibn Kathir is explaining HOW Allah brought 'Isa into the world through the virgin Mary.  It doesn't say that 'Isa is the word &quot;Be.&quot;
</p>
<div class="quotes">Jibril blew the life of `Isa into Maryam by Allah's leave, and `Isa came to existence as a result. This incident was in place of the normal conception between man and woman that results in children. This is why `Isa was a word and a Ruh (spirit) created by Allah, as he had no father to conceive him. Rather, he came to existence through the word that Allah uttered, `Be,' and he was, through the life that Allah sent with Jibril.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12951?sid=4&tid=12951">Tafsir Ibn Kathir - Prohibiting the People of the Book From Going to Extremes in Religion</a></div></div>
<p>The verse in question is <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/003-qmt.php#003.059#003.059">3:59</a> which states:
</p>
<div class="quotes">The similitude of Jesus before Allah is as that of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him: &quot;Be&quot;. And he was.<br> </div>  
<p>Yes, the conception of 'Isa was similar in the sense that Allah didn't need to provide a paternal father and can create a human out of mere dust if he wants, but the Quran says 'Isa was created when <a href="wiki/Allah_and_Marys_Vagina.html" title="Allah and Marys Vagina">the angel Gabriel blew Allah's spirit into Mary's vagina</a>.
</p><p>Ibn Kathir's convoluted explanation continues...
</p>
<div class="quotes">`Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said that the Ayah, <i>And His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from [created by] Him;</i> means, He said, &quot;Be&quot; and he was. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ahmad bin Sinan Al-Wasiti said that he heard Shadh bin Yahya saying about Allah's statement, <i>and His Word, which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit from [created by] Him;</i> &quot;`Isa was not the word. Rather, `Isa came to existence because of the word.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12973?sid=4&tid=12973">Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Meaning of &quot;His Word and a spirit from Him</a></div></div>
<p>Allah's word can be a specific speech sound like &quot;Be,&quot; if Allah literally said, &quot;Be.&quot;  So in that sense, 'Isa was not the word &quot;be.&quot;  However, the Quran specifically states in other verses that 'Isa is a word from Allah.  What Ibn Kathir and other Muslims have attempted to do is blur the meanings of 'Isa being a word from Allah and 'Isa being born from a virgin in the same manner that Adam was created.  Who 'Isa is and how he was born are two very separate things.  For example, in the &quot;Book of Miscellany&quot; from the <i>Riyad-us-Saliheen</i> we read: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Prophet `Isa (Jesus) has been referred in the Qur'an as &quot;Kalimatullah&quot; (the Word of Allah) (4:171). What these words really mean is that he was born in an unusual manner, without being fathered by anyone, only on the express fiat of Allah.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Allah,_His_Word,_and_'Isa.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>A logical, coherent explanation is never given for why the words say one thing but mean something completely different.  Instead, what we are told is that 'Isa is how he came to be.  In other words, the phrase &quot;word of Allah&quot; (when applied to 'Isa) really means &quot;person created by the word of Allah.&quot;  Why this is so is never explained.
</p><p>Continuing on in the Tafsir Ibn Kathir...
</p>
<div class="quotes">Al-Bukhari recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Prophet said, &quot;If anyone testifies that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that `Isa is Allah's servant and Messenger and His Word which He bestowed on Maryam and a spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is true and Hell is true, then Allah will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he performed.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12973?sid=4&tid=12973">Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Meaning of &quot;His Word and a spirit from Him</a></div></div> 
<p>Well, look at that!  Confirmation from Muhammad that 'Isa is Allah's Word!
</p>
<div class="quotes">In another narration, the Prophet said,&quot;...through any of the eight doors of Paradise he wishes.&quot; Muslim also recorded it. Therefore, `Ruh from Allah', in the Ayah and the Hadith is similar to Allah's statement, &quot;And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all from Him.&quot; meaning, from His creation. `from Him' does not mean that it is a part of Him, as the Christians claim, may Allah's continued curses be upon them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12973?sid=4&tid=12973">Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Meaning of &quot;His Word and a spirit from Him</a></div></div>
<p>Now Ibn Kathir gets really desperate...
</p>
<div class="quotes">Saying that something is from Allah, such as the spirit of Allah, the she-camel of Allah or the House of Allah, is meant to honor such items. Allah said, <i>This is the she-camel of Allah and, </i>and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it.<i> An authentic Hadith states, &quot;I will enter on my Lord in His Home.&quot; All these examples are meant to honor such items when they are attributed to Allah in this manner.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12973?sid=4&tid=12973">Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Meaning of &quot;His Word and a spirit from Him</a></div></i></div>
<p>What a tangent...and it explains nothing since one must rely on <i>petitio principii</i> (<a href="wiki/Logical_Fallacy.html" title="Logical Fallacy">logical fallacy</a> of begging the question). Nevermind that in the verses talking about the word &quot;Be&quot; the Arabic <i>kalima</i> is never used.   Also, the term &quot;she-camel of Allah&quot; does not necessarily imply that the she-camel was FROM Allah.  The Quran states 'Isa is a spirit and word FROM Allah, not just &quot;of&quot; like a title of honor.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muslim_Claim:_.27Isa_is_only_a_message">Muslim Claim: 'Isa is only a message</span></h3>
<p>&quot;A word&quot; of Allah means a message of Allah. If a person is referred to as &quot;a word&quot; from Allah, it means that he is a Messenger or a Prophet of Allah.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Allah,_His_Word,_and_'Isa.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>This is an interesting assertion since Muhammad never claimed HIMSELF to be a word from Allah but rather that he brought a message: the Quran.  Muhammad claimed to be a messenger, not the message itself.  But here we see that 'Isa himself was the message from Allah.  If 'Isa was the message, then what was the Injil?  If Allah were being consistent, he would say not that 'Isa was a word but rather that the INJIL was a word from Allah.
</p><p>Where does the conclusion come from that if a person is referred to as &quot;a word&quot; then that means they weren't really a word but rather brought the word?  In fact, as previously noted in a narration provided in the Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 'Isa is identified as a Messenger AND Allah's Word.  So, 'Isa was both the message-bringer and the message itself.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jesus_Christ.2C_the_Word.2C_and_the_Bible">Jesus Christ, the Word, and the Bible</span></h3>
<p>Scholars such as the Reverend W. St. Clair-Tisdall have argued that far from being of divine origin, the Quran is a compilation of various religious and traditional sources.
</p><p>In the Greek gospel of John, the author used the word <i>logos</i> when referring to God's &quot;Word&quot;.  It does not mean a literal &quot;word&quot; such as was defined earlier but rather means something closer to &quot;intellect.&quot;  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)" class="extiw" title="w:Logos (Christianity)">Wikipedia's article</a> for a more in-depth explanation on the Christian theology of the Logos.  Justin Martyr, one of the most important of the Greek philosopher-Apologists in the early Christian Church (2nd century A.D.), identified Jesus Christ as the incarnation of the entire divine <i>logos</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Allah,_His_Word,_and_'Isa.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="quotes">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:1-5&version=NIV?search=John%201:1-5&version=NIV">John 1:1-5 NIV</a></div></div>
<p><b>John the Baptist identified as a witness</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:6-8&version=NIV?search=John%201:6-8&version=NIV">John 1:6-8 NIV</a></div></div>
<p><b>Christ identified as the Word and John confirmed as his witness</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only,<sup>[or Only Begotten]</sup> who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.  John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, &quot;This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' &quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14-15&version=NIV?search=John%201:14-15&version=NIV">John 1:14-15 NIV</a></div></div>
<p>It is not implausible that Muhammad heard from Waraqa, Khadija's Christian relative, or other Christians that they believed Jesus is the Word of God and John the Baptist his witness.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps Mark Beaumont put it best when he wrote
</p>
<div class="quotes">If Christ is word and spirit from God then surely he shares attributes of God in such a way that makes him divine as well as human.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Allah,_His_Word,_and_'Isa.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>It goes to show that Islamic theology is completely contradictory when it comes to Muhammad's stance on Christ.  He believed 'Isa was a word and spirit from Allah and yet he was loathe to assign him with any divinity as the Christians did (since he had an inaccurate, confused understanding of the Trinity and elevating Christ would probably have undermined Muhammad's central importance to his new religion.)
</p><p>When explaining the meaning of the Quran, for centuries Muslims have said that a simple phrase means something entirely different than how it would be typically understood under any other circumstances.  In an attempt to prove his legitimacy as a prophet to Christians, Muhammad incorporated typical Christian beliefs into his Quranic revelations never realizing that in doing so he elevated 'Isa to a status that contradicted the Islamic theology of no one being like Allah.
