<div class="quotes">And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for their disobedience and transgression.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.061#002.061">2:61</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">&quot;And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe. And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know (to be the truth) they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers. Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.088#002.088">2:88</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes"><b>Question</b>: One of the preachers in one of the mosques in Europe claimed that it is not allowed to consider Jews and Christians disbelievers. You know - may Allah preserve you - that most of the people who attend the mosques in Europe have very little knowledge. We fear that statements like this one will become widespread. Therefore, we request from you a complete and clear answer to this question. 
<p><b>Answer</b>:I say: The statement that came from that man is misguidance. In fact, it can be blasphemy. This is because Allah has declared that Jews and Christians are disbelievers (kuffaar) in His Book. Allah has said, &quot;And the Jews say, ‘Ezra is the son of Allah,’ and the Christians say, ‘The Messiah is the son of Allah.’ This is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allah’s curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth. They took their rabbis and their monks as lords besides Allah and [they also took as Lord] the Messiah, son of Mary. But they were commanded only to worship none but One God. Praise and Glory be to Him, [far above is He] from having the partners they associate with Him.&quot; [at-Taubah 9:30-31] That shows that they are polytheists who associate partners with Allah. In other verses, Allah has made it clear that they are disbelievers: 
</p><p>&quot;Surely in disbelief are they who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.&quot; [al-Maidah 5:17 and 72] 
</p><p>&quot;Surely, disbelievers are those who said, ‘Allah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].&quot; [al-Maidah 5:73] 
</p><p>&quot;Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary.&quot; [al-Maidah 5:87] 
</p><p>&quot;Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book and the idolaters will abide in the Fire of Hell.&quot; [al-Bayyinah 98:6] 
</p><p>Many verses and hadith express the same meaning. The one who rejects the idea that the Jews and the Christians who do not believe in Muhammad [peace be upon him] and deny him are disbelievers is, in fact, denying what Allah has said. Denying what Allah has said is blasphemy. If anyone has any doubt concerning them being disbelievers, then he himself is also a disbeliever. 
</p><p>Glory be to Allah! 
</p><p>How could that man be pleased to say that it is not allowed to say that they are disbelievers when they themselves say that Allah is one of a Trinity? Their Creator Himself has declared that they are disbelievers. 
</p><p>How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers when they actually say, &quot;Jesus is the son of God&quot; or &quot;the hand of Allah is tied,&quot; and &quot;Allah is poor and we are rich&quot;? 
</p><p>How could this man not be pleased to call them disbelievers and apply the word of disbelief (kufr) to them in general when they describe their Lord in such ways that are nothing but cursing and abusing Allah? 
</p><p>I call upon that man to repent to Allah and to read Allah’s words, &quot;They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so that they (too) would compromise with you.&quot; [al-Qalam (68):9] He should make it clear to everyone that they are disbelievers and that they are the inhabitants of the Hell-fire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &quot;By the One in whose hand my soul is, no Jew or Christian of this community hears about me - that is from the community of people from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) until the Day of Judgment - and then does not follow me - or he said does not believe in what I brought - except that he is from the inhabitants of the Hell-fire.&quot; [Saheeh Muslim] 
</p><p>The one who made such a statement must repent to his Lord because of this great falsehood he has stated. He must make a clear announcement that they are disbelievers and that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire. He must also announce that it is obligatory upon them to follow the unlettered Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). he is the one that the Jews and the Christians know and they know him like they know their own sons. Allah has stated, &quot;Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.&quot; [al-Araf 7:157] 
</p><p>He is the one of whom Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him) gave glad tidings. Jesus said, as His Lord states in the Quran, &quot;O Israel, I am the Messenger of Allah for you confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad [one of the names of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him]. But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ‘This is clear magic.’&quot; [as-Saff 61:6] 
</p><p>When the one, Ahmad, who was promised came to them with clear signs, they said that it was nothing but magic. By this, we can refute those Christians who say that the one Jesus promised was named Ahmad and not Muhammad. We say to that that Allah said, &quot;When he came with clear proofs,&quot; and none has come to you after Jesus except Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muhammad is Ahmad and Allah inspired Jesus to call Muhammad Ahmad. This is because Ahmad is a name from the root meaning, &quot;to praise,&quot; and the name itself means, &quot;One who praises Allah more than others.&quot; Therefore, [Muhammad (peace be upon him)] is the most praiseworthy of Allah among all peoples... 
</p><p>I further say: If anyone claims that there is a religion on earth other than Islam that is acceptable to Allah, then the person who made that claim is a disbeliever and there is no doubt about his disbelief. This is because Allah has said in His Book, &quot;Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers. [ali-Imran 3:85]. Allah has also said, &quot;Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam&quot; [ali-Imran 3:19]. Another verse states, &quot;This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&quot; [al-Maida 5:3] 
</p><p>Based on that - and I repeat it for a third time - the person who made that statement [mentioned in the question] must repent to Allah, Most High. And he must also make it clear to all the people that those Jews and Christians are disbelievers. This is so because the proof has been established against them, they have received the message but they have refused to believe. 
</p><p>The Jews have been described as those who have earned Allah’s wrath. That is because they knew the truth and chose to go against it. The Christians have been described as those who have gone astray. This is because they sought the truth but were misled from it. Now, all of them have knowledge of the truth and recognize it. However, they go against it. Therefore, they all deserve to have the wrath of Allah upon them. I call all those Jews and Christians to believe in Allah and all of His Messengers. I call upon them to follow the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This is what they have been ordered to do in their own books. Allah states in the Quran, &quot;My Mercy embraces all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are God-fearing and give zakat, and those who believe in Our revelations. Those who follow the Messenger, the illiterate Prophet whom they find written about with them in the Torah and the Gospel, he commands what is right and forbids what is evil. He allows them the good things and forbids for them disdainful things. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the fetters that were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful. Say (O Muhammad): O Mankind! Verily, I am sent to all of you as the Messenger of Allah, to whom belongs the heavens and the earth. There is no true God but He. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered, who believes in Allah and His Words. And follow him so that you may be guided.&quot; [al-Araf 7:156-158]. 
</p><p>[By having such faith, those converts from Judaism and Christianity] shall receive their reward twice. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &quot;There are three people who will receive their rewards twice: A person from the People of the Book [Jews and Christians] who believed in his prophet and believed in Muhammad...&quot; [al-Bukhari and Muslim]. 
</p><p>I have also found in the law book al-Iqna`, in the section on apostasy, where the author has stated, &quot;One who does not consider as a disbeliever one who follows a religion other than Islam, such as the Christians, or who has doubt about their disbelief or who approves of their way himself is a disbeliever.&quot; And he quotes Ibn Taimiya as saying, &quot;[The following is] a disbeliever: Whoever believes that churches are the houses of Allah in which he He is worshipped or who thinks that what the Jews and Christians do are valid acts of worship of Allah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, or loves or approves of what they do, or aids them in having such places and establishing their religion, and he does so thinking that is a way of getting closer to Allah or worshipping Allah.&quot; He also stated, &quot;If someone believes that visiting the Jews and the Christians in their places of worship is an act that brings him closer to Allah, then he is an apostate.&quot;

<div class="quotes">History witnessed repeated violations by the Jews of their treaties with the Muslim state in Madinah, as also their scheming against the Muslims. These violations led to the encounters with the Jewish tribes of Qaynuqa, al-Nadir and Qurayzah, and also the Battle of Khaybar. Their efforts to bring together all the forces hostile to Islam in an unholy affiance, with the aim of exterminating Islam altogether, are well known.
<p>They have continued to scheme against Islam and the Muslim community ever since. They were instrumental in the chaotic events that led to the assassination of the third rightly-guided Caliph. 'Uthman ibn 'Affan and to the emergence of division in the Muslim community. They were the main culprits in the conflict that took place between 'Ali and Mu 'awiyah. They led the way in the fabrication of false statements attributed to the Prophet, historical reports and baseless interpretations of Qur'anic statements. They also paved the way to the victory of the Tartars and their conquest of Baghdad and the fall of the Islamic Caliphate. 
</p><p>In modern history, the Jews have been behind every calamity that has befallen the Muslim communities everywhere. They give active support to every attempt to crush the modem Islamic revival and extend their protection to every regime that suppresses such a revival.
</p><p><b>History Tells Its Tale</b>
</p><p>The other people of earlier revelations. the Christians, have been no less hostile. Enmity between the Byzantines and the Persians went back for centuries. Nevertheless, as soon as the Church felt that Islam. the new faith, represented a threat to its concocted version of Christianity, which was no more than a collection of ancient pagan legends, misguided inventions and a handful of statements from the Prophet Jesus, both camps buried all their past enmity and age old-hatred to confront the new faith together.
</p><p>Then the expedition to Tabuk. which is the major subject of discussion in this surah, took place. followed by the march of the army commanded by Usamah ibn Zayd. This was prepared by the Prophet and dispatched by his successor, Abu Bakr. in a demonstration of power to confront the Byzantine forces being mobilized to suppress the voice of Islam. Then the Muslims achieved a great victory in
the Battle of Yarmuk against the Byzantines. This ushered in the liberation of wide areas of Syria, Egypt, North Africa and the Mediterranean from Byzantine colonialism. and the consolidation of an Islamic base in Andalusia. These final rulings. as they are stated in this surah, deal with a specific situation that obtained in Arabia, and serve. in a sense. as a legislative prelude to the Tabuk campaign. the-central issue of the surah, which sought to confront the Byzantine mobilization close to the Arabian borders. But the attitude of the people of earlier revelations and their hostility to Islam and the Muslim community were not the result of any particular historical event. or limited to any stage. That is a permanent reality. They will continue to be at war with Islam until the Muslims have abandoned their faith altogether. This hostility and the war it launches will continue to be fed by all possible means. Hence, the rulings outlined in this surah remain in full effect, unlimited to a particular period of history.
</p><p><b>A Fight until Submission</b>
</p>
<blockquote><i>Fight against those who-despite having been given Scripture-do not truly believe in God and the Last Day. and do not treat as forbidden that which God and His Messenger have forbidden, and do not follow the religion of truth, till they [agree to] pay the submission tax with a willing hand, after they have been humbled. (Verse 29)</i></blockquote>
<p>This verse and the ones that follow were meant to prepare the Muslims for their expedition to Tabuk and the confrontation with the Byzantines and their puppet regime of Christian Arabs, known as the Ghassanld. This suggests that the descriptions we have here were true of the people on the other side of the confrontation. They simply show the reality of those people. These descriptions are not mentioned here as conditions for fighting the people of earlier revelations, but as qualities inherent in their distorted beliefs and the actual reality of those people. Hence they provide the justification for fighting them. The ruling also applies to all those who share the same beliefs and characteristics.
</p><p>This verse specifies three such characteristics. (1) They do not believe in God and the Last Day; (2) they do not treat as forbidden what God has forbidden; and (3) they do not believe in the religion of truth. The verses that follow show how these characteristics apply to them.
</p><p>Firstly, the Jews claim that Ezra is the son of God, and the Christians assert that Christ is His son. These claims echo similar ones made by the pagans of former times. Hence, they are to be treated on the same basis as people who do not believe in God and the Last Day. Secondly, they treat their rabbis and their monks, as well as Jesus Christ, as their Lords, in place of God. This is in total conflict with the principles of the faith of truth which is based on total submission to God alone, who has no partners. As they make such claims they demonstrate that they are idolaters who do not follow the true faith. Thirdly, they try to put out the light of God's guidance with their mouths. In other words, they are at war with the divine faith. No one is ever at war with the divine faith if he truly believes in God. Fourthly, many of their monks and rabbis devour peoples property without any justification. They do so knowing that their claims to such property are false. Hence they do not treat as forbidden what God and His Messenger have made forbidden, whether we take this statement as referring to the Messenger sent to them or to the Prophet Muhammad.
</p><p>All these characteristics were true of the Christians in Syria and the Byzantines, as well as other Christians ever since Church Synods distorted the faith preached by Jesus Christ and claimed that he was the son of God and invented the concept of the Trinity, the conflict between the different sects and churches over the concept of Trinity notwithstanding. What we have here then is a general order stating a universal rule that applies to all those among the people of earlier revelations who share the same characteristics as the Christians of Syria and Byzantium. Aggression has been committed in the first place, against God's Lordship of the universe and against human beings who are forced to submit to deities other than God. As Islam tries to defend God's Lordship and human dignity, ignorance will try to stop it by aggression and war. This is the reality we have to realize. This Qur'anic verse commands the Muslims to fight against those among the people of earlier revelations who &quot;do not believe in God and the Last Day.&quot; A person who claims that Ezra or Jesus is the son of God cannot be described as a
believer in God. The same applies to a person who says that the Christ is the Lord, or that God is one of a Trinity, or that He manifested Himself in Jesus. It further applies to all concepts formulated by the Synods, diverse as these concepts are.Nor can we describe as believers in God and the Last-Day-those who say that they will suffer God's punishment only for a few days no matter what sins they may commit because God loves them as His sons and daughters, or because
they are God's chosen people. The same applies to those who claim that all sins are forgiven through a holy communion with Jesus Christ, which is the only way to achieve forgiveness. Neither of these two groups can be described as believers in God or in the Last Day.
</p><p>This verse also describes the people of earlier revelations as ones who do not treat as forbidden what God and His Messenger have made forbidden. Whether the term &quot;His Messenger&quot; refers to the Messenger whom God sent to them in particular or to the Prophet Muhammad, the import is the same. The following verses explain this by saying that they devour other people's property by false claims, an action which has been forbidden in all divine messages and by all God's messengers. Some of the clearest examples of this are usurious transactions, the sale of bonds of forgiveness by the Church, opposition to the divine faith with brutal force as well as trying to turn believers away from their faith. Another clear example is forcing people to submit to beings other than God, and forcing them to implement laws other than those revealed by God. All these examples are covered by the description: &quot;who do not treat as forbidden what God and His Messenger have forbidden.&quot; All this applies today to the people of earlier revelations as was applicable to them when this verse was revealed.
</p><p>The Qur'anic verse also describes them as not following &quot;the religion of truth.&quot; This is clear from what we have already said. It is not part of the religion of truth to believe in the Lordship of anyone other than God, or to apply a law different from God's law, or to accept legislation enacted by any authority other than God, or to submit to anyone other than Him. All these qualities are today true of the people of earlier revelations, as it was true of them then. The condition simply that they should pay the tribute, or the submission tax, with a willing hand and that they be utterly subdued. What is the purpose of this condition, and why is it the end at which all fighting must stop? The answer is found in the fact that with such characteristics, the people of earlier revelations place themselves at war with the divine faith, both in belief and in practical terms. They are also at war with Islamic society because of the inherent conflict between the codes of living derived from the divine faith on the one hand and ignorance, or jahiliyyah, on the other. As described in these verses, the people of earlier revelations belong to jahiliyyah in both beliefs and practices. History also proves the nature of conflict, and the impossibility of co-existence between the two codes. The people of earlier revelations were determined in their opposition to the Islamic faith in the period preceding the revelation of this verse, and in the period following it, up to the present day.
</p>
As the only religion of truth that exists on earth today, Islam takes appropriate action to remove all physical and material obstacles that try to impede its efforts to liberate mankind from submission to anyone other than God. That submission is translated in following the religion of truth, provided that every human being is given free choice. There must be no pressure either from the religion itself or from those forces putting up the physical obstacles. The practical way to ensure the removal of those physical obstacles while not forcing anyone to adopt Islam is to smash the power of those authorities based on false beliefs until they declare their submission and demonstrate this by paying the submission tax. When this happens, the process of liberating mankind is completed by giving every individual the freedom of choice based on conviction. Anyone who is not convinced may continue to follow his faith. However, he has to pay the submission tax to fulfill a number of objectives...by paying this tax, known as jizyah, he declares that he will not stand in physical opposition to the efforts advocating the true Divine faith. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-People_of_the_Book.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sayyid Qutb (D. 1966), In the Shade of the Qur'an, vol. 8: Surah 9</div></div>

<p>This is something that is well known among the Muslims, and they are unanimously agreed that the Christians are kaafirs, and even that those who do not regard them as kaafirs are also kaafirs. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said concerning the things which are unanimously agreed to nullify Islam: 
</p><p>“Whoever does not regard the mushrikoon as kaafirs, or doubts that they are kaafirs, or thinks their religion is correct, is himself a kaafir.”<br>. . .<br>
</p>
This trinity in which the Christians believe is not one of the things that lead to shirk [disbelief, polytheism], rather it is the essence of shirk. The trinity that the later Christians have fabricated has no evidence in reason and fitrah (the innate nature of man), and there is nothing to support it in the divinely-revealed Books which Allaah sent down.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://islamqa.com/en/ref/12713">&quot;Is the trinity that the Christians believe in mentioned in Islam?&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fislamqa.com%2Fen%2Fref%2F12713&date=2013-12-06?url=http%3A%2F%2Fislamqa.com%2Fen%2Fref%2F12713&date=2013-12-06">archived</a>)</span><br> Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 12713<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://islamqa.com/en/ref/12713">http://islamqa.com/en/ref/12713</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Is+the+trinity+that+the+Christians+believe+in+mentioned+in+Islam%3F&rft.atitle=&rft.series=Fatwa+No.+12713&rft.pub=Islam+Q%26A&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fislamqa.com%2Fen%2Fref%2F12713&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:People_of_the_Book"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Jews and Christians are both kaafirs and mushrikeen. They are kaafirs because they deny the truth and reject it. And they are mushrikeen because they worship someone other than Allaah. 
<p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>[Quotes <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.0030-31#009.0030-31">9:30-31</a> and <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/098-qmt.php#098.001#098.001">98:1</a>]</i>
</p><p>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, refuting those who say that the word mushrikeen cannot be applied to the People of the Book: 
</p><p>It is most likely that the people of the Book are included among the mushrikeen, men and women alike, when this word is used in general terms. because the kuffaar are undoubtedly mushrikeen. Hence they are forbidden to enter al-Masjid al-Haraam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <i>[Quotes <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.028#009.028">9:28</a> and <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.031#009.031">9:31</a>]</i>
</p><p>So they are all described as mushrikeen, because the Jews said that ‘Uzayr is the son of God and the Christians said that the Messiah is the son of God; and because they took their priests and rabbis as lords instead of Allaah. All of this is the worst form of shirk. And there are many similar verses. End quote.

<div class="quotes">This opinion about the Christians is well established and does not stem from the Crusades or the oppression of the colonialists and their aggression against Muslim lands. If anyone rejects the [uncurrupted] message of Jesus (peace be upon him) or the [uncurrupted] message of Moses (peace be upon him) or the message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he is a kaafir (disbeliever).

<div class="quotes">The marriage of a Christian man to a Muslim woman is an invalid marriage. Allah says in the Quran, 
<p>&quot;And give not [Muslim women] in marriage to idolaters until they believe&quot; 
</p><p>(al-Baqara 221).
</p><p>Therefore, it is not allowed for a disbeliever to marry a Muslim woman. Allah also says,
</p><p>&quot;They [Muslim women] are not lawful for them [the disbelievers] nor are they [the disbelievers] lawful for them&quot; (al-Mumtahana 10).
</p>
If he does marry her, the marriage is invalid. The children are the children of fornication. They are to be given to their mother and ascribed to her alone -- unless that was done out of ignorance concerning such law. For ignorant people, the matter is different. In their case, the marriage is still invalid. However, the children will be ascribed to the father since the act was done out of ignorance. That is, if he was ignorant of the law and she was also, the marriage is still invalid but the children will be ascribed to their parents due to their ignorance and there was some doubtful aspect to their intercourse.1 But if he knew the Islamic ruling and she knew the Islamic ruling and they were being lax and disrespectful of the law of Allah, then the children are children of fornication. They will be ascribed to their mother and will not be ascribed to their father at all. The couple should be reprimanded and the penal punishment should be enforced upon him for having intercourse with a Muslim woman when he did not have the legal right to do so. This is what must be done if the Islamic state has the ability to do it. If he becomes Muslim after that and Allah guides him, then he can marry her with a new contract.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040216151301/http://www.uh.edu/campus/msa/articles/fatawawom/marriage.html">Ruling Concerning a Christian Man Marrying a Muslim Woman</a><br>Shaikh ibn Baz, Q&amp;A site of the Muslim Students Organization of the University of Houston</div></div>

<p>You should not initiate the greeting to a Jew or Christian. If a Muslim inadvertently greets a dhimmi, he does take it back.

[ It is confirmed that the Prophet. may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade initiating it. This prohibition is one of dislike.

<div class="quotes"><i>Question</i>
<p>What are the Ayah in Qur'an which mentioned the Christians and Jews and explain the Islam's position towards both religions?
</p><p><i>Answer</i>
</p><p>Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the World; and may His blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions. 
</p><p>So many verses in the Noble Qur'an show the prejudice, hatred and disbelief by the non-believers. They unduly change the words of the Scriptures as they like, and attribute to Allah some disgraceful qualities.
</p><p>The Jews and Christians are called the &quot;People of the Scripture&quot; (or the Book). Due to the notoriety of the crusades among the Muslims, the Church officials preferred to be called Christians despite the fact that they are not true followers of Jesus Christ. Muslims should have no doubt that they are Kafirs. Please find below some of the verses in the Qur'an which refer to the Christians and Jews and their hostile attitude towards the Muslims: 
</p><p>The Noble Qur'an: 
</p><p>{Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islâm, the Qur'ân and Prophet Muhammad ()) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikûn will abide in the Fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures.} [98:6]. 
</p><p>{Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allâh, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allâh and His Messenger (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islâm) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.} [9:29].
</p><p>{They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allâh (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allâh), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) to worship none but One Ilâh (God - Allâh) Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him, (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).&quot;} [9:31].
</p><p>{Say: &quot;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you reject the Ayât of Allâh (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) while Allâh is Witness to what you do?&quot;} [3:98].
</p><p>{And the Jews say: 'Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allâh, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allâh. That is a saying from their mouths. They imitate the saying of the disbelievers of old. Allâh's Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!} [9:30].

<div class="quotes">Question: &quot;Does someone who insults the Torah or the New Testament engage in apostasy, given that these include some words of God?&quot;
<p>Answer: &quot;It would be impermissible to disdain the Torah and New Testament if they contained the truth and the name of the exalted, such as the name of God the Most High. Whoever does this [i.e., disrespect the books] knowingly and by choice would be considered an apostate and would be despised by God. But [in fact] the Torah and New Testament do not have anything exalted in them. They are known to have been corrupted, so there is no problem disdaining them.
