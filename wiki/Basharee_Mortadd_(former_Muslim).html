<p>[Letter from Basharee Mortadd to Ali Sina]
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_I_left_Islam">Why I left Islam</span></h2>
<p>I was born to Muslim parents who, like most religious parents, were guilty of indoctrinating their children into a religion they never even chose for themselves. Fortunately for me, I always kept an open mind. I was also smart enough to keep my mouth shut until I moved to a Western country. Soon after, I learned enough about Islam to have had enough of it. I felt so ashamed to even feel proud of this ideology of hate. I cannot believe I used to actually invite non-Muslims to this faith. But my intentions were not evil. I used to invite them because they were my friends (being the ignorant Muslim I was, I did not let the fact that I cannot befriend non-Muslims sink into my head). I did not want them to go to hell because I loved them and I wanted to save them from an eternal punishment. 
</p><p>I am glad they were not interested in my invitations and preaching. Westerners today tend to be so anti-Christian they want to turn to any other faith. Being a simplistic (read: primitive) religion and properly sanitized by deceiving Muslims, they find it appealing to convert to Islam. You particularly find that among non-white people who want to rebel against what they perceive to be an exclusively white religion. Another ex-Muslims recent testimony, which I encourage you to read in full, says: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Harboring an aversion for a decadent Judaeo-Christian modernity, believers born into Christianity began to search for meaning elsewhere. The prevailing vehicles facilitative to escaping a sinking Western society were usually Buddhism, Islam, and secular humanism. Islam, the fastest growing religion, was an ubiquitous mantra. The vast majority considered converting to Islam following a relationship with a Muslim. When an empathetic accord with a Muslim peer ensued, exposure to Islam increased in addition to curiosity while submerging into a foreign culture. The medias popular portrayal of Islam would be contradictory with a first-hand experience with Muslims. Western society seemed to degrade women as exploitable objects while Islam offered a woman security and respect. When juxtaposed to our Christian environment, adherents to Islam exhibited uppermost consciousness of God; they appeared pietistic to the halaal (permissible) and apathetic to the haraam (impermissible). The foremost decisive factor captivating soul searchers to Islam was aversion for and disillusionment with the West or dunyaa (this temporal world, as opposed to the Hereafter). <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Abdul_Quddus_(former_Muslim).html" title="Abdul Quddus (former Muslim)">Abdul Quddus (former Muslim)</a> </div></div>
<p>Back on topic: Being an ex-Muslim, one would expect that I have been liberated and that I am living in happiness. You expect me to move on with my life and to put my past life of darkness and ignorance behind. 
</p><p>I truly wish that were the case. Don't take me wrong. I have never felt more liberated than during the first days during which I felt I no longer fear the fictitious Allah. It's an amazing feeling to realize that you can actually think for yourself, and be your own prophet. In fact, allow me to sound boastful when I say that leaving Islam is a powerful intellectual accomplishment. People who have not lived in Dar Al-Islam cannot and will not understand the level of indoctrination Muslims undergo for their entire lives. When you don't train your muscles, you become physically weak. It's no different with the mind. If you've never used your mind but rather simply lived under the culture of submission (Islam means submission, by the way), your ability to think withers.
</p><p>Submission to whom? To your parents, to your teachers, to your local imam, to your king. Dare not question. Dare not think differently from the majority or you will face ostracism at best and death at worse. (Personally, I would prefer getting killed instead of facing humiliation from a community). 
</p><p>And yet, albeit the freedom to think, it is far from over. Being an ex-Muslim is just the beginning. When Neo swallowed the red pill, the movie did not end and we had two (poorly scripted) sequels of The Matrix.
</p><p>The reasons I still seem attached to Islam are numerous. To name a few:
</p><p>First off, I have to live as a closet apostate. The founder of Islam gave me good reasons 1400 years ago: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">
The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/083-sbt.php#009.083.017#009.083.017">9:83:17</a> </div></div>
<p><i>(Repeated in Sahih Muslim)</i> 
</p>
<div class="quotes">
Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/084-sbt.php#009.084.057#009.084.057">9:84:57</a> </div></div>
<div class="quotes">
There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu'adh asked, &quot;Who is this (man)?&quot; Abu Muisa said, &quot;He was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism.&quot; Then Abu Muisa requested Mu'adh to sit down but Mu'adh said, &quot;I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/084-sbt.php#009.084.058#009.084.058">9:84:58</a> </div></div>
<p><i>(Repeated in Sahih Muslim as well.)</i> 
</p><p>Phew. Argumentum ad baculum is definitely not a convincing argument for me to return to Islam, but this seventh-century madman sure did give me good reason to keep my apostasy to myself. I hate it. It seems that I can see the light and the world outside this cage but I still cannot go out and enjoy what life has to give. I still have to pretend I'm a Muslim. I am never at ease with myself when I'm not being myself. I was never a good liar (and that's a blessing). 
</p><p>I would disagree that I'm safe to practice my faith (or 'non belief') in a Western democracy. Unfortunately, it looks more like a dhimmiocracy to me each day. It frustrates me how the West tries to appease those who hate us and want us converted, subjugated, or killed (I'm looking at you, CAIR.)
</p><p>Which brings me to the second reason why I'm blogging: I want to save the product of Judeo-Christian reform called the West. Many of those born into the West do not appreciate what it means to be born with free will, with guaranteed free speech, and with a separation of the church and state. Coming from the hellhole of Islam, I do, and I intend to preserve it. I will not allow my children to go through the psychological hell Islamic nations are going through. I will not allow it for your children. 
</p><p>Islam is a dangerous political ideology that separates the world into &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;, into Muslim versus kafir, into Dar Al-Islam versus Dar Al-Harb. If there is anything I want you to learn from this boring rant, it's this: Muslims cannot coexist in peace with non-Muslims. Muslims hate you and will never be pleased with you unless you're a living Muslim, a humiliated dhimmi, or a dead infidel:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.029#009.029">9:29</a></div></div>
<p>When we talk about tolerance, we mean one of two things: Either that Islam will be peaceful only when the whole world becomes Muslim, or that we are tolerant enough to allow Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians to live among us as second-class citizens under the dhimma treaty.
</p><p>The third reason why I'm blogging is because I want to help my people. They are infected with the illness of Islam and I wish to save them from it. Unfortunately, I need to set my feelings aside and realize that it is unlikely to result in mass apostasy. Educating them into being human beings is slow compared to their high procreation rates, which was also ordered by their prophet.
</p><p>The West must, then, learn the truth about Islam so we can ban Muslim immigration and figure out how to handle the Muslim populations already living among us (well, near us, they usually live in ghettos and in closed circles).
</p><p>I invite everyone, Muslim or non-Muslim, to contact me with any inquiries that they may have on Islam. I shall respond to each of you as time permits. This is an obligation I will live up to. 
</p><p>Generally, I have been trying to help in other ways that I shall not disclose for obvious safety reasons. However, I have noticed the growth of apostate bloggers lately, and that got me thinking of having a blog for myself in support of those brave brethren. We need to stand together during this difficult time. What better place to do it than on the Internet and blogosphere, where the worse that can happen to us is receive hate mail and death threats? Thanks to the Internet, the truth will be shown. Muslims can no longer harm us because we use anonymous identities.
</p><p>I plan on playing around with the blog for some time, and add links to fellow apostate bloggers, testimonies of ex-Muslims, and &quot;Islamocritical&quot; Web sites. Will I blog much? Probably not. I have a personal family matter I need to attend to for a while, and additionally, I in no way claim to be able to write as eloquently as my fellow ex-Muslims. Time will tell how blogging will go for me. But simply setting this page up is a powerful statement of support for them and for all closet apostates worldwide.
</p><p>I urge all apostates of Islam to open up Web sites and blogs exposing the truth about Islam. In fact, you need not even write about Islam in your blog. Just mention that you are an apostate and write about anything else, be it your job, your dog, your obsession about Anne Coulter (off the top of my head), etc. Merely mentioning your apostasy is sufficient to sow the seeds of doubt in Muslims who find apostasy to be as impossible as dividing a number by zero. 
</p><p>Let us stand in solidarity with these fine soldiers!
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 
<p>And say: The truth has come and the falsehood has vanished; surely falsehood is a vanishing (thing).
