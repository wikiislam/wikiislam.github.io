But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).

This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me.
