<p><b>Jizyah</b> or <b>jizya</b> (جزْي) is the extra tax imposed on non-Muslims (<a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Dhimmitude.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Dhimmitude">Dhimmis</a>) who live under Muslim rule according to the <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a>:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold forbidden that which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.029#009.029">9:29</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">&quot;I call you to God and to Islam.  If you respond to the call, then you are Muslims:  You obtain the benefits they enjoy and take up the responsibilities they bear.  If you refuse, then you must pay the jizyah.  If you refuse the jizyah, I will bring against you tribes of people who are more eager for death than you are for life. We will then fight you until God decides between us and you.&quot; (Al Tabari, Volume XI)<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Khalid bin Al-Waheed (Muslim General, 632AD)</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Summon the people to God; those who respond to your call, accept it from them, but those who refuse must pay the poll tax out of humiliation and lowliness.

</p><p>Once a land is conquered by Islamic armies the ruler can impose a taxation on those non-Muslims who will not convert to <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. 
</p><p>Jizyah is paid as a sign of submission and gives Dhimmis some legal protection in return. Under dhimmitude (the status that <a href="wiki/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law" class="mw-redirect">Islamic law</a>, the Sharia, mandates for non-Muslims) Dhimmis usually are not allowed to carry arms to protect themselves, serve in the army or government, display symbols of their faith, build or repair places of worship etc. If the conquered do not wish to pay or convert, their fate may very well be slavery (under which, <a href="wiki/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> is permitted) or (as evidenced in the quotes above) death. 
</p><p>The amount of the Jizyah tax and the way it was collected varied from time to time and from place to place, but when imposed, the forced payment of Jizyah greatly stimulated the conversion of non-Muslims into Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Jizyah_(Tax).html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> In some cases the taxation of the non-Muslims was so profitable that the Islamic rulers prohibited their subjects from converting to Islam, lest they should lose their income.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Context">Context</span></h2>
<p>To be fair to history; Jizyah was not entirely an Islamic initiative or the innovation of its prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, (Emphasis on the word “entirely”). A certain form of Jizyah had existed among the tribes of Northern Arabia in pre-Islamic times. This fact is attested by the famous historian Philip. K. Hitti in his <i>History of Arabs</i>. <i>Ghazw</i> (غزو) or raiding others for feeding mouths was an accepted norm among the Bedouin tribes of that time. As <i>Hitti</i> noted, &quot;Ghazw was a manly occupation of Bedouins where fighting mood was a chronic mental condition&quot;. For people among the tribes, everything that belonged to the other tribes guaranteeing material gain made a legitimate target. The context made it necessary for a weaker tribe or a sedentary settlement on the borderland to buy protection from the stronger tribe by paying what it then called <i>Khuwwah</i> which later became Jizyah in Muhammad’s Islam. Along with the booty acquired through raids and wars, Jizyah turned out to be a good source of income for believers when they were constantly occupied in spreading the newly founded religion by means of violence. To sum up, by imposing Jizyah on subjugated unbelievers Muhammad was reinstating an undivine tribal norm into his religion, thus broadening an abject backward practice.

<div class="quotes">Allah said, (until they pay the Jizyah), if they do not choose to embrace Islam, (with willing submission), in defeat and subservience, (and feel themselves subdued.), disgraced, humiliated and belittled. Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are miserable, disgraced and humiliated. Muslim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, &quot;Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians, and if you meet any of them in a road, force them to its narrowest alley.&quot; This is why the Leader of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, demanded his well-known conditions be met by the Christians, these conditions that ensured their continued humiliation, degradation and disgrace.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=9&tid=20986?sid=9&tid=20986">Paying Jizyah is a Sign of Kufr and Disgrace</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Approval_from_Islamic_Scholars">Approval from Islamic Scholars</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">The Muslims do not fight anyone until they have told them about the religion of Allaah and given them the choice between two things, either accepting Islam or, if they refuse Islam and keep their own religions, paying the Jizyah (tax) to the Muslims in return for protection. If they refuse both of these choices, then they are to be fought.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid</div></div>
<div class="quotes">If some people persist in rejecting the religion of Allaah and stand in the way of ruling by that which Allaah has revealed on earth, or they fight against the call to Allaah, then we give them the choice of three things: Either they become Muslim; or if they refuse they pay the jizyah (whereby they pay a specified amount to the Muslims in return for being allowed to remain their land, and the Muslims undertake to protect them); or, if they refuse that, there is nothing left but the way which they themselves have chosen, which is fighting and dealing violently with those who have persecuted the Muslims and put obstacles in the path of the Islamic da’wah. In this way the Muslims will gain the upper hand and the enemies will be humiliated; then when we have killed and wounded many of them and gained the upper hand over them, we may take prisoners and bind a bond firmly on them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ahkaam al-Sijn wa’l-Sujana’ wa Mu’aamalat al-Sujana’ fi’l-Islam by Hasan Abi’l-Ghuddah, 256</div></div>
<p>Saudi Sheikh Muhammad bin Abd Al-Rahman Al-'Arifi, Imam of the mosque of King Fahd Defense Academy, discussed the coming Muslim conquest of the Vatican. Citing a Hadith in an article posted on the Kalemat website in 2002, he stated:
</p>
<div class="quotes">&quot;… We will control the land of the Vatican; we will control Rome and introduce Islam in it. Yes, the Christians, who carve crosses on the breasts of the Muslims … will yet pay us the Jiziya [poll tax paid by non-Muslims under Muslim rule], in humiliation, or they will convert to Islam…&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Jizyah_(Tax).html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Saudi Sheikh Muhammad bin Abd Al-Rahman Al-'Arifi</div></div>
<div class="quotes">&quot;It may happen that the enemies of Islam may consider it expedient not to take action against Islam, if Islam leaves them alone in their geographical boundaries to continue the lordship of some men over others and does not extend its message and its declaration of universal freedom within their domain.  But Islam cannot agree to this unless they submit to its authority by Jizyah...&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.kalamullah.com/Books/MILESTONES.pdf">Milestones (Ma'alim 'ala Al-Tariq) p.73</a><br>Sayyid Qutb</div></div>
<div class="quotes">This is the aim of Jihad with the Jews and the Christians and it is not to force them to become Muslims and adopt the `Islamic Way of Life.' They should be forced to pay Jizyah in order to put an end to their independence and supremacy so that they should not remain rulers and sovereigns in the land. These powers should be wrested from them by the followers of the true Faith, who should assume the sovereignty and lead others towards the Right Way, while they should become their subjects and pay jizyah...
<p>[The Islamic State] cannot allow that they should remain supreme rulers in any place and establish wrong ways and impose them on others. As this state of things inevitably produces chaos and disorder, it is the duty of the true Muslims to exert their utmost to bring to an end their wicked rule and bring them under a righteous order. 
</p>
As regards the question, &quot;What do the non-Muslims get in return for Jizyah?&quot; it may suffice to say that it is the price of the freedom which the Islamic State allows them in following their erroneous ways, while living in the jurisdiction of Islam and enjoying its protection. The money thus collected is spent in maintaining the righteous administration that gives them the freedom and protects their rights. This also serves as a yearly reminder to them that they have been deprived of the honor of paying Zakat in the Way of Allah, and forced to pay jizyah instead as a price of following the ways of error.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.englishtafsir.com/Quran/9/index.html#sdfootnote29sym#sdfootnote29sym">Commentary on Qur'an Chapter 9:29</a><br>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, Tafhim al-Qur'an</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Once Muhammad Bin Qasim had established himself in Sindh he sent a letter to the Muslim Caliph in Damascus, seeking instruction as to how he should deal with the Hindus and Buddhists of the conquered area. The reply came that they be treated in accordance with the Quranic commandments relating to the People of the Book (Ahl-i-Kitab), the Jews and the Christians. Accordingly, the Buddhists and the Hindus of Sindh were to be given full freedom to practise their faiths, and their lives and property, including temples, were to be protected. In return, they were to pay a tax, the jizya. The old, the sick, children and priests were to be exempted from the tax. The non-Muslims were not obliged to perform military service, unlike the Muslims. Following these dictates, Muhammad Bin Qasim thus set a precedent which several other Muslim rulers after him followed.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.himalmag.com/apr2001/commentary.html">Idolatry and the Taliban</a></div></div>

Despite the supposed reforms that were to bring complete legal equality to non-Muslims in Turkey, in World War II the Varlik Vergesi was a large tax imposed by the government on non-Muslim citizens, who despite Kemalism, or perhaps because of it, have never been considered &quot;Turks&quot; equal to Muslim &quot;Turks.&quot; 
<p>In Malaysia the non-Muslims have been subject to the disguised Jizyah of the Bumiputra system, which favors economically the Muslims, and essentially involves a transfer of wealth from the more industrious and entrepreneurial non-Muslims (Chinese and Hindus) to Muslims (Malays, but not the members of the indigenous tribes, which were christianized, or remained pagan -- and only now are being islamized through intense pressure and Da'wa campaigns). 
</p>
Elsewhere, as in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the Hindus and Christians live in a state of permanet physical danger, and that danger also is one of losing their property to Muslim looters and marauders who cannot be sued or brought to justice on the say-so of a non-Muslim. The Jews of the Arab world fled -- nearly one million of them -- leaving their property, which was the last transfer of wealth. In Egypt, under Nasser, the property of most Jews and the Levantine Christains -- Greeks, Italians, and others -- were &quot;nationalized&quot; as Nasser put it. But this was nothing more than the seizure of Infidel property by Muslim governments. Copts in Egypt do not pay a direct Jizyah. But there are other ways to force local Christians, constantly fearful for their own well-being, to have them pay off, or take as local partners, Muslims who may protect them. There is no security for the property of non-Muslims in Muslim lands, and there are various ways in which the &quot;protection money&quot; that is the Jizyah is paid, often in indirect, informal, and disguised ways, when the more direct imposition would attract too much unwanted Western attention and, presumably, outrage.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/016325.php">Hugh Fitzgerald, Dhimmiwatch</a></div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Zakat">Zakat</span></h3>
<p>Some will say that Muslims also had to pay a tax equivalent to the jizjah paid by Dhimmis'. It is true that Muslims, under the empire, paid a tax called zakat. However, this zakat is a 2.5% tax, while the jizyah (which can vary) is about a 10% income tax (although it has been known to be as high as 50%). Muslims are obligated to pay this so-called &quot;charity tax&quot; even today, as its one of the five pillars of Islam. But, instead of paying it to the state, they now pay zakat to charities of their choice. It must however be noted that the majority of Islamic scholars are of the view that non-Muslims should not benefit from this alms giving,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Jizyah_(Tax).html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> which is why we find mainstream Islamic charities, like Islamic Relief, almost exclusively<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Jizyah_(Tax).html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> focusing their humanitarian work in Muslim majority nations or areas in non-Muslim countries which are heavily populated by Muslim minorities. In the aftermath of the 2010 Pakistan floods, many Christian survivors were denied aid supplied by Muslim charities for this very reason.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Jizyah_(Tax).html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<div class="quotes">Devshirme (derived from , &quot;collection, gathering&quot;; called &quot;collection of boys&quot; or &quot;blood tax&quot; in Balkan countries in their native languages) was the systematic abduction of young boys from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal slave army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the &quot;Janissaries&quot;, or other servants such as tellak in hamams. . Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ghilmán or acemi oglanlar (&quot;novice boys&quot;).<br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kharaj">Kharaj</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Tax imposed on recent Islamic converts in the 7th–8th century. 
In Islamic territories, Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians who did not convert to Islam were required to pay a tax called the jizya. Many people converted to Islam to avoid this tax or to escape the ban on non-Muslims owning land. As financial problems mounted for the Umayyad rulers, authorities imposed the kharaj as a property tax for recent converts. Popular opposition to the tax led to a revolt in 747 and precipitated the downfall of the Umayyad dynasty.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316354/kharaj">kharaj</a><br>The Encyclopædia Britannica</div></div>
