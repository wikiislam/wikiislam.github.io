<p>It is permissible to give regular charity – <b>not obligatory</b> charity (i.e., zakaah) to poor kaafirs, and to exhange gifts and with them and treat them well <b>to soften their hearts towards Islam</b>, so long as they have not carried out any hostile actions against the Muslims, which would disallow that.

<p>There are eight categories of people eligible to receive Zakat. They have been specified in the Noble Qur'an what can be translated as, &quot;Alms are for the poor, the needy, the employees who administer the funds, those whose hearts have been recently reconciled to the Truth, those in bondage, those in debt, in the cause of Allah, and the wayfarer, (thus it is) ordained by Allah, and Allah is most knowledgeable, most wise.&quot; [Surah At-Tawbah (9:60)]
</p><p>Based on this verse, the ways of spending Zakat funds can be classified as follows:
</p><p>1. For the poor (Fuqara') who do not have enough to take care of their basic needs.
</p><p>2. For the needy (Masakeen) whose basic needs are met but their income does not take care of other important needs.
</p><p>3. For those whose sole job is to collect and distribute the Zakat funds.
</p><p>4. <b>For those who are close to accepting Islam as a religion, and those non-Muslims whose evil can be avoided if they receive money</b>.<br>. . .<br>
WHO IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ZAKAT?
</p><p>There are categories of people who are not eligible to receive Zakat. They include: 
</p><p>1. the rich who have enough to support themselves
</p><p>2. the healthy person who is capable of working and earning his living, unless he cannot find a job or his job does not provide him with enough money to support himself and his family. About these two categories, the Prophet (SAW) said: &quot;Alms are not to be given to the rich or to the well-built.” [An authentic Hadith reported by Imam Abu Dawood] The term &quot;well-built” conveys the meaning that he is able to work and support himself.
</p><p>In addition, Zakat cannot be paid to: 
</p><p>3. one's dependents whom he is responsible for supporting. These include the wife, the parents, grandparents (up to the eldest living grand grandparent), children, and grandchildren (down to the last born grand grandchild).

<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i>
<p>Imam of our Masjid has given Fatwa that Zakat can be given to non muslims. They give reference to the Ayah in Qur'an that it does not prohibit in detail giving zakat to nonmuslims. Can you please give your response.
</p><p><i>Answer:</i>
</p><p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</p><p>Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh 
</p><p>At the outset, you must understand that not all the commands are expressly mentioned in the Quraan. There are many instances where Allah would indicate a command and not elaborate. For example, lets take the command of Salaah. Allah only states &quot;Perform your Salaah and discharge your Zakaat&quot;. Where in the Quraan do we find the explanation of how many Rakaats to perform for Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Esha? Where in the Quraan does Allah mention the minimum amount on which Zakaat has to be discharged? 
</p><p><b>Surely, these are not mentioned in the Quraan. These are explained in detail by our beloved Rasulullah ( صلى الله عليه و سلّم  ) in his Ahadith</b>. Do not become fooled by those who only claim to follow the rulings of the Quraan and ignore the Ahadith. The Quraan and Hadith are inseparable and one can never be guided if he/she ignores any one.
</p><p>You state that the Imaam has referred to an Ayah of the Quraan that states it is permissible to give Zakaat (obligatory) to non Muslims. <b>You may ask him to forward that Ayah to us. We have not come across any such Ayah</b>. Furthermore, the <b>Fuqahaa are express in their works that it is not permissible to give Zakaat to non Muslims</b>. 
</p><p>Therefore, you should not become deceived by people who claim to only follow the Quraan. There is no need to discuss this issue in detail as any person with sound academic background would know this. If the Imaam is sincere he may contact us directly and we would engage with him on an academic level after coming to know his qualifications. We do not wish to discuss issues with someone whom we do not know as sometimes this is time consuming and a futile exercise. 
</p><p>And Allah knows best

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spend_on_Jihad">Spend on Jihad</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">The most honorable form of jihad nowadays is fighting for the liberation of Muslim land from the domination of unbelievers, regardless of their religion or ideology. The communist and the capitalist, the Westerner and the Easterner, Christian, Jew, pagan or unbeliever, all are aggressors when they attack and occupy Muslim land. Fighting in defence of the home of Islam is obligatory until the enemy is driven away and Muslims are liberated.<br>. . .<br>
<p>Today Muslim land is occupied in Palestine, Kashmire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Chad, Somalia, Cyprus, Samarqand, Bukhara, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Albania and serveral other occupied countries. Declaring holy war to save these Muslim lands is an Islamic duty, and <b>fighting for such purposes in those occupied territories is the Way of Allah for which zakat must be spent</b>.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
The most important form of jihad today is serious, purposefully organized work to rebuild Islamic society and state and to implement the Islamic way of life in the political, cultural and economic domains. <b>This is certainly most deserving of zakat</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Fiqh az-Zakat: A Comparative Study</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i> 	 
<p>As-salamu `alaykum.Is a Muslim allowed to spend some of the money of Zakah (obligatory charity) on his journey to take part in Jihad in the Cause of Allah?
</p><p><i>Answer:</i>
</p><p>Wa `alaykum as-salam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.
</p><p>In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
</p><p>All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.
</p><p>First of all, we would like to thank you for the great confidence you have in us. We hope our efforts meet your expectations.
</p><p>It is the duty of every Muslim to support all his fellow Muslims in all times especially at times of calamities as all Muslims constitute one body when an organ of it aches, all the other organs feel ill as a result. In his Hadith, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stated: <i>&quot;A Muslim is a brother of a Muslim. He must not wrong him, nor fail him, nor hand him over (to enemies).&quot;</i> Muslim scholars state that there is nothing wrong in paying the Zakah as well as sadaqah to oppressed Muslims in Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Burma and in every part of the world.
</p><p>In his response to the question, <i>Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi</i>, the prominent Muslim scholar, states the following:
</p><p>The meaning of Jihad in our present time particularly refers to striving to liberate Muslim lands from the grip of the disbelievers who usurped them and imposed on them their own laws in lieu of the Divine Law. Those disbelievers may be Jews, Christians or both or even pagans, who follow no particular religion at all. Disbelievers are all alike.
</p><p>Capitalists, Communists, Westerners, Easterners, People of the Book and pagans are by no means different from one other. They should all be fiercely fought if they attempt to occupy any part of the Muslim land. This duty falls on those closest to the occupied land, who should be aided by those closest to them, who, in turn, ought to be aided by those closest to them, till it becomes incumbent on all Muslims to take part in Jihad.
</p><p>Muslims have never been more severely afflicted than they are nowadays. Many of their lands have been captured by the disbelievers, on top of which is Palestine that has fallen victim to corrupt Jews. Similarly, Kashmir has been dominated by pagan Hindus. Chechnya and other Islamic states have fallen in the grip of pagan tyrannical communism.
</p><p>Retrieving these lands, freeing them from the clutches of atheists and their twisted laws is the joint responsibility of all Muslims. Declaring Jihad to save our land is an Islamic obligation.
</p><p>If war is waged anywhere to achieve this goal, namely to free the occupied lands of the laws and the tyranny of disbelievers, it is undoubtedly <b>a case of Jihad for the sake of Allah. It thus needs to be financed from the money of Zakah</b>, the amount of which is to be decided based on the total sum of the charity, the requirements of Jihad as well as the degree of the need of other potential recipients of charity. This is all to be decided by reliable scholars, if they are to be found.

<div class="quotes">WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ZAKAT?
<p>There are eight categories of people eligible to receive Zakat. They have been specified in the Noble Qur'an what can be translated as, &quot;Alms are for the poor, the needy, the employees who administer the funds, those whose hearts have been recently reconciled to the Truth, those in bondage, those in debt, in the cause of Allah, and the wayfarer, (thus it is) ordained by Allah, and Allah is most knowledgeable, most wise.&quot; [Surah At-Tawbah (9:60)]
</p><p>Based on this verse, the ways of spending Zakat funds can be classified as follows:<br>. . .<br>
</p>
7. In the cause of Allah (SWT): the scholars have said that what is meant here is that <b>Zakat can be given to those who volunteer to fight in the cause of Allah</b> (SWT) and do not receive a fixed salary from the government.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://islam1.org/iar/imam/archives/2004/12/30/zakatulmal_zakat.php&date=2011-10-14?url=http://islam1.org/iar/imam/archives/2004/12/30/zakatulmal_zakat.php&date=2011-10-14">Zakat-ul-mal (Zakat)</a><br>Imam's Corner, The Islamic Association of Raleigh</div></div>

(n: In the Hanafi school, it is valid for the giver to distribute his zakat to all of the categories, some of
them, or to confine himself to just one of them (al-Lubab fi sharh al-Kitab(y88), 1.155).)<br>. . .<br>
THOSE FIGHTING FOR ALLAH
</p>
<b>h8.17</b> - <b>The seventh category is those fighting for Allah, meaning people engaged in Islamic military operations</b> for whom no salary has been allotted in the army roster (O: but who are volunteers for jihad without remuneration). They are given enough to suffice them for the operation, even if affluent; of weapons, mounts, clothing, and expenses (O: for the duration of the journey, round trip, and the time they spend there, even if prolonged. Though nothing has been mentioned here of the expense involved in supporting such people's families during this period, it seems clear that they should also be given it).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.shafiifiqh.com/maktabah/relianceoftraveller.pdf">Reliance of the Traveller: A Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law</a><br>Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri, Edited and Translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller</div></div>
