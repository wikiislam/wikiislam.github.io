<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>When we diligently study the biography of <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and the ahadith we find quite a few examples where Muhammad had openly transgressed the provisions of the <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>. Sex was an important aspect of Muhammad’s life. His unbridled indulgence in sex had, on many occasions, forced him to violate <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>’s rule overtly. To suppress his breach of the Qur’anic laws on sex and sexuality, he, as usual, concocted stories of Allah’s exemption to His dearest friend. In this essay I am exposing the hypocrisy of some Islamists who claim adamantly that Muhammad could have never violated the Qur’an. What follows are examples of how Muhammad had violated the Qur’an vis-à-vis sex.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_violated_the_Qur.E2.80.99anic_rule_on_sex_during_fasting">Muhammad violated the Qur’anic rule on sex during fasting</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an dictates regulations about having sex during fasting. 
</p><p><b>The following verse resticts sexual activities to the night only: </b> 
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what Allah Hath ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast Till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are Limits (set by) Allah: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to men: that they may learn self-restraint. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.187#002.187">2:187</a></div></div>  
<p><b>Here is what Muhammad did while observing fast:</b> 
</p><p>Muhammad slept with Umm Salama during her period, kissed her while fasting and used to take bath from the same pot after having sex:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama:
Um-Salama said, &quot;I got my menses while I was lying with the Prophet under a woollen sheet. So I slipped away, took the clothes for menses and put them on. Allah's Apostle said, 'Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' Then he called me and took me with him under the woollen sheet.&quot; Um Salama further said, &quot;The Prophet used to kiss me while he was fasting. The Prophet and I used to take the bath of Janaba from a single pot.&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/006-sbt.php#001.006.319#001.006.319">1:6:319</a></div></div> 
<p>While fasting, Muhammad kissed and embraced his wives:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Aisha:
The Prophet used to kiss and embrace (his wives) while he was fasting, and he had more power to control his desires than any of you. Said Jabir, &quot;The person who gets discharge after casting a look (on his wife) should complete his fast.&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/031-sbt.php#003.031.049#003.031.049">3:31:49</a></div></div>
<p>Muhammad used to kiss and suck Aisha's tongue while they were fasting:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) used to kiss her and suck her tongue when he was fasting. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/013-sat.php#013.2380#013.2380">13:2380</a> </div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_violated_the_Qur.E2.80.99anic_rules_on_dower">Muhammad violated the Qur’anic rules on dower</span></h2>
<p>When Muhammad captured Khaybar, he took as a captive Safiyyah bt Huyayy, a very pretty teenage-girl and married her without paying her any dowry (<a href="wiki/Mahr.html" title="Mahr">Mahr</a>). The payment of Mahr is compulsory in the <a href="wiki/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law" class="mw-redirect">Islamic law</a> of marriage.  
</p><p>First, we shall examine how Muhammad violated the rule of dower. 
</p><p><b>This rule is stipulated in the Qur’an thus:</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">   And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.004#004.004">4:4</a></div></div>
<p>To hide his deception, Muhammad claimed that marrying Safiyyah was in itself a good honour for her, her dowry was her manumission from being a sex-slave to Muhammad. Muhammad consummated his marriage with Saffiyah by staying with her for three days on way from Khaybar; he ordered her to wear a <a href="wiki/Hijab.html" title="Hijab">veil</a>:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas bin Malik:
The Prophet stayed with Safiya bint Huyai for three days on the way of Khaibar where he consummated his marriage with her. Safiya was amongst those who were ordered to use a veil. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.523#005.059.523">5:59:523</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas:
The Prophet stayed for three rights between Khaibar and Medina and was married to Safiya. I invited the Muslim to his marriage banquet and there was neither meat nor bread in that banquet but the Prophet ordered Bilal to spread the leather mats on which dates, dried yogurt and butter were put. The Muslims said amongst themselves, &quot;Will she (i.e. Safiya) be one of the mothers of the believers, (i.e. one of the wives of the Prophet) or just (a lady captive) of what his right-hand possesses&quot; Some of them said, &quot;If the Prophet makes her observe the veil, then she will be one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of the Prophet's wives), and if he does not make her observe the veil, then she will be his lady slave.&quot; So when he departed, he made a place for her behind him (on his and made her observe the veil.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.524#005.059.524">5:59:524</a></div></div>
<p>Muhammad stayed with Safiyyah for three nights consummating his marriage:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Anas b Malik said: When the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) married safiyyah, he stayed with her three nights. The narrator 'Uthman added: She was non-virgin (previously married). He said: This tradition has been narrated to me by Hushaim, reported by Humaid, and transmitted by Anas.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/011-sat.php#011.2118#011.2118">11:2118</a> </div></div>
<p>Saffiya’s 'dower' for marriage was her manumission:
</p>
<div class="quotes">This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters on the authority of Anas that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) emancipated Safiyya, and her emancipation was treated as her wedding gift, and in the hadith transmitted by Mu'adh on the authority of his father (the words are):&quot; He (the Holy Prophet) married Safiyya and bestowed her emancipation as her wedding gift.&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3326#008.3326">8:3326</a></div></div>
<p>Further information on this lustful marriage with a 19-year-old Jewish beauty with 60-year-old Muhammad is gleaned from the narration of Ibn Sa’d. It should be noted that before falling into the hands of Muhammad, this pretty young women was married to a Jewish man. Muhammad had already killed Safiyaah’s husband and her father after subjecting them to brutal torture, and finally beheading them. Having satiated his lust for blood, on the same night he killed her closest relatives, Muhammad took Saffiyah into his tent to have sex with her. 
</p><p>We learn from Ibn Sa’d that Muhammad purchased Safiyyah from Dhiyah for seven camels (around US$ 2,100). On the same night that Muhammad took possession of Safiyyah, he hastened to his tent to sleep with her. Here is what Ibn Sa’d writes: 
</p>
<div class="quotes"> …when it was night, he entered a tent and she entered with him. Abu Ayyub came there and passed the nigh by the tent by the tent with a sword keeping his head at the tent. When it was morning and the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, perceived (some body) moving, he asked: Who is there? He replied: I am Abu Ayub. He asked: Why are you here? He replied: O Apostle of Allah! There is a young lass newly wedded (to you) with whose late husband you have done what you have done. I was not sure of safety, so I wanted to be close to you. Thereupon the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said twice: O Abu Ayyub! May Allah show you mercy.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sad-Tabaqat: Vol.2 p.145</div></div>
<p>To hide the lascivious character of Muhammad, Muslim biographers often mention that he married Safiyyah before he slept with her. But they forget to state that Muhammad did not follow the rule of waiting period (three monthly periods) to sleep with Safiyyah.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_violated_the_rule_of_iddah">Muhammad violated the rule of iddah</span></h2>
<p>We shall now see how Muhammad had violated the rule of <i>idda</i> (waiting period) in marrying a woman. 
</p><p><b>The following rules are stipulated in the Qur'an:</b> 
</p><p>Before marrying another man, a divorced woman must wait three monthly periods:   
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.228#002.228">2:228</a></div></div>  
<p>Widows must wait four months and ten days for re-marriage:   
</p>
<div class="quotes"> If any of you die and leave widows behind, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days: When they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.234#002.234">2:234</a></div></div>
<p>Muhammad violated this rule by having sex with Safiyyah, the wife of a Jewish Rabbi. After conquering Khybar, a Jewish village, Muhammad killed Safiyyah's husband and selected her for himself due to her beauty, making her his wife and giving a banquet at the wedding; then he had sex with Saffiyah at Sa`d-AsSahba: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas bin Malik:
The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &quot;Choose one of your boy servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar.&quot; So, Abu Talha took me letting me ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I used to serve Allah's Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, &quot;O Allah! I seek refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men.&quot; Then we reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while she was a bride. So Allah's Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,' where her menses were over and he took her for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Allah's Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of Allah's Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina . I saw Allah's Apostle folding a cloak round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him) He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina ; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and said, &quot;This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us.&quot; Then he looked at Medina and said, &quot;O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina 's) two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of Medina ) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures).&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/052-sbt.php#004.052.143#004.052.143">4:52:143</a></div></div>
<p>Clearly, when Muhammad desired to sleep or to have sex with Safiyyah, she was a widow, technically, as Muhammad had just killed her husband. Therefore, as per the Qur’an, Muhammad had to wait at least four months and ten days before he could even touch her. But Muhammad did not at all observe this rule; instead, he took Safiyyah, straight from the battlefield to his bed in the war camp. Having spent the night with her, Muhammad took her to another, safer location, staying there for three days and consummating his marriage with Safiyyah. 
</p><p>Plainly; Muhammad violated the Idda rule of the Qur'an. The <a href="wiki/Sahih.html" title="Sahih">Sahih</a> <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> from Bukhari above is evidentiary to this.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_violated_the_restriction_on_the_number_of_his_wives">Muhammad violated the restriction on the number of his wives</span></h2>
<p>When Muhammad married Zaynab bt Jahsh, the wife of his adopted son, Zayd b. Harith, Allah was mildly displeased with his audacious craving for young, beautiful, sexy and luscious women, married or single. So Allah clamped down on Muhammad and sternly warned him that this was enough, that he could not further accumulate any extra wives. Allah made Zaynab, Muhammad’s wife number eight or nine, the last wife. Here is the verse where Allah forbade Muhammad to marry further after marrying Zaynab bt Jahsh:  
</p><p><b>Allah put restriction on Muhammad's marriage:</b> 
</p><p>he is not to take any new wife, neither exchange old wives for new:
</p>
<div class="quotes">It is not lawful for thee (to marry more) women after this, nor to change them for (other) wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess (as handmaidens): and Allah doth watch over all things.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/033-qmt.php#033.052#033.052">33:52</a></div></div> 
<p>Now, let us have a look at the list of women with whom Muhammad had had some kind of connection, including sexual. This list has been prepared from the book of Tabari (vol. ix, pp.120-141). Please note that this list is in chronological order. I have marked (<b>*</b>) the name of Zaynab to demonstrate how flagrantly Muhammad had dishonoured Allah’s restriction on him! He had collected at least 13 more wives, a sex-slave and a concubine even when Allah commanded him to restrain his wife collection.   
</p><p><b>Muhammad had married 21 wives:</b>

<p>Fornication and adultery are two most serious offences in Islamic societies. The punitive measures, as enacted in the Qur’an are truly extremely harsh and barbaric. 
</p><p><b>Let us read the verse which deals with such grave crimes:</b> 
</p><p>Punishment for adultery or fornication (both man and woman) is one hundred lashes in front of the believers:   
</p>
<div class="quotes">The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php#024.002#024.002">24:2</a></div></div> 
<p>Strangely though, when it came to a friend of Muhammad, who admitted having committed a punishable offence (illegal sex, perhaps), Muhammad did not apply this Qur’anic rule. Here is a hadith from Sahih Bukhari on this violation of the Qur’an:   
</p><p>Muhammad did not punish a person for illegal sexual intercourse because the person prayed with him... 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas bin Malik:
While I was with the Prophet a man came and said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! I have committed a legally punishable sin; please inflict the legal punishment on me'.' The Prophet did not ask him what he had done. Then the time for the prayer became due and the man offered prayer along with the Prophet , and when the Prophet had finished his prayer, the man again got up and said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! I have committed a legally punishable sin; please inflict the punishment on me according to Allah's Laws.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Haven't you prayed with us?' He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Allah has forgiven your sin.&quot; or said, &quot;....your legally punishable sin.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/082-sbt.php#008.082.812#008.082.812">8:82:812</a></div></div>

<p>Please note, that a man and a woman who are not close relatives (that is, those men and women who could be married to each other, those who are not in the prohibited class for marriage purposes) cannot, under any circumstances, be alone together.

<p>Now, let us see what Muhammad did with some single women, who could be married to him. 
</p><p>The first such woman was none other than his first cousin-sister, Umm Hani bt Abu Talib. Muhammad passionately fell in love with her, but for some unknown reason his beloved uncle, Abu Talib did not give her hand to Muhammad when requested. Instead, she was married to a pagan, Hibayrah. But Muhammad’s adulterous relation with Umm Hani (real name Fakitah, also known as Hind) continued. He used to sleep in her house, when no one was around. Such an incidence took place when Muhammad returned from his failed mission at Taif, after the deaths of his first wife, Khadijah and his uncle Abu Talib. Returning from Taif, he took shelter in the <a href="wiki/Kaaba.html" title="Kaaba">Ka'aba</a>. But at nightfall, when all were asleep, he stealthily went to Umm Hani’s house and spent the night with her. When the people did not find him at Ka’aba, they went looking for him and when he was discovered in the house of Umm Hani, he was embarrassed, so was Umm Hani. To hide the truth, he concocted the story of his night journey to Jerusalem and Paradise from Umm Hani’s house (more precisely, from her bed), which many converted Muslims found too incredible to believe and left Islam. This made him sad and withdrawn. Soon, after such an adulterous affair was leaked out, he left Mecca and settled in Medina . But his undying love for Umm Hani remained aflame. 
</p><p>Later, when Muhammad became militarily strong and conquered Mecca , he went to Umm Hani’s house and stayed there overnight, praying and chit-chatting with her. Hubayrah, Umm Hani’s husband had foreseen the fall of Mecca and had fled to Najran. So, Umm Hani was living in her house, separated from her pagan husband, and Muhammad was there comforting her, in open transgression of the Qur’anic code. (Please consult: <i>Martin Lings, p.33, 101, 103-104, 299; Ibn Ishaq, p.184, Tabari, vol.viii, p.186</i>) 
</p><p>Here is a hadith from Sahih Bukhari which demonstrates Muhammad’s way with single women, divorced or widowed, rich or poor, for sex, which clearly violates the Qur’an. A dignified woman, Jauniyaa (a princess) was brought to Muhammad to have sex with him but she was reluctant to give herself to him; Muhammad was angry and raised his hand to beat her... 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Abu Usaid:
We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, &quot;Sit here,&quot; and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu'man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, &quot;Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift.&quot; She said, &quot;Can a princess give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?&quot; The Prophet raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, &quot;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&quot; He said, &quot;You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, &quot;O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family.&quot; Narrated Sahl and Abu Usaid: The Prophet married Umaima bint Sharahil, and when she was brought to him, he stretched his hand towards her. It seemed that she disliked that, whereupon the Prophet ordered Abu Usaid to prepare her and to provide her with two white linen dresses. (See Hadith No. 541). <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/063-sbt.php#007.063.182#007.063.182">7:63:182</a></div></div>

One night he entered (upon me) while I was menstruating. He went to the place of his prayer, that is, to the place of prayer reserved (for this purpose) in his house. He did not return until I felt asleep heavily, and he felt pain from cold. And he said: Come near me. I said: I am menstruating. He said: Uncover your thighs.

<p>Even a hadith in Sunaan Abu Dawud confirms the stipulation of the Qur’an. This hadith says: 
</p><p>“A pilgrim must not marry and give someone in marriage in the sacred state (while wearing ihram)” 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Nubaih b. Wahb, brother of Banu Abd al-Dar said: Umar b. Ubaid Allah sent someone to Aban b. Uthman b. Affan, asking him (to participate in the marriage ceremony). Aban in those days was the chief of pilgrims, and both were in the sacred state (wearing ihram). I want to give the daughter of Shaibah b. Jubair to Talhah b. Umar in marriage. I wish that you may attend it. Aban refused and said: I heard my father Uthman b. Affan narrating a tradition from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: A pilgrim may not marry and give someone in marriage in the sacred state (while wearing ihram). <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/010-sat.php#010.1837#010.1837">10:1837</a> </div></div>  
<p>But Muhammad did not have much regard for the Qur’an or even to his own words when it came to marrying women and having sex with them. So, when he went to Mecca, to perform the Hajj, and a proposal of marriage was offered to him, he quickly accepted the offer and married the woman even though he was in sacred state wearing ihram.   
</p><p>Here is the hadith from Sunaan Abu Dawud:  
</p><p>Muhammad married Maimunah while he was in the sacred state wearing ihra:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
