<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Letter_to_Ali_Sina_from_Qadir_Sheikh">Letter to Ali Sina from Qadir Sheikh</span></h2>
<p>Dear Janaab Ali Sina, 
</p><p>My real name is Qadir Sheikh, I am an Indian and I was a Muslim until 7/7. I tried to find out what prompted these 3rd generation Muslims in Britain to kill themselves and others. In that quest I went to my local Maulvi in the mosque and in a bizarre twist of arguments and counter arguments led to angered arguments and freely flying abuses and insults from the Maulvi. My kufr was that the Maulvi did not like the questions; he also did not have the answers and called it 'highly un-Islamic behaviour' to ask forbidden questions which challenge the validity of the Quran. One of my questions was: &quot;Whom should a person owe more allegiance to? His maadr-e-watan (motherland) or the Ummah (Nation of Islam)?&quot; This led us to argue about how much of a true Muslim each of us were, and for how many generations? In the end I was called a &quot;kafir&quot; (some who commits a kuffr [blasphemy]) and physically thrown out of the same mosque where I had offered my namaz (obligatory prayer) for the last 37 years, by the Maulvi's assistants. 
</p><p>That led me to investigate the land records of my family and led me to the identity of my Hindu ancestors (just five generations back), and I have since decided to come back to the Hindu culture if not the religion. I feel that my Hindu ancestors were subjected to torture and humiliation and also had to pay jaziya taxes which they could not afford due to drought in the region, which finally led them to accept Islam. Though I continue to keep my Muslim name (due to records in many places like my school certificates, driving license, bank account etc.) I have stopped practicing Islam, and I have become a murtad (apostate), kafir or both; as Islam classifies me. I have added 786 to my email name because I believe there is something magical and special about it as I believe that Allah (God) has as many names as there are languages in this world. Allah means Bhagwaan/Ishwar in Hindi and God in English. But the local mullahs anywhere in the world are still required to call for azaan in the Arabic language only. &quot;Allah-u-Akbar&quot; means &quot;God is great&quot; or &quot;Ishwar mahaan hai&quot;. This is nothing but cultural dominance and imperialism of the Arabs via the vehicle of religion. 
</p><p>But many Hindus think in India that &quot;Allah-u-Akbar&quot; is a war cry and a call to kill the non-Muslims. Oh my God! What a blasphemy has been committed and is being committed in Allah's name by the Muslims themselves. I realize that I have more Hindu blood in my veins than Mughal blood and it's time that I woke up the rest of my community in India to this fact and not get into clashes with their Hindu brethren with whom they share genes, food, culture, motherland, economy, language and everything else except this foreign religion, brought in forcefully by the Arab looters and invaders and forced upon them under the blade of sword. Killing of Hindus in the past is nothing to be proud of by the Muslims but should be a matter of sorrow for all Muslims in India because all our ancestors were Hindus and were forced to convert to Islam under threat. Converting to Islam does not mean that we Muslims in India became Arab. I am trying to awaken Muslims of all ethnicities in India to this fact about how they are being misled by these mullahs everyday. Islam was suited to the kind of social situation, which was prevalent in Arabia of Mohammed's time. 
</p><p>I was recently very upset about the formulation of Muslim marriage laws by AIMPLB (All India Muslim Personal Law Board). There were hardly any women in the board meeting. I do not understand what kind of marriage laws can be discussed and formulated without the participation of women in equal numbers. What kind of marriage laws can be discussed by a group consisting only (or mostly) of men? What is the guarantee of honour of my educated and good sisters when they get married tomorrow under these Muslim marriage laws formulated by someone in Arabia and interpreted by someone in India? How can I prevent my future brother-in-laws from dumping my good sisters and marrying other women? I realized that on the whole, we Muslims are doing nothing but marrying each others sisters, only to use, abuse and dump them in the end like Mohd. Azaharuuddin (former Indian cricket captain) has done by divorcing his first wife, who is much more beautiful and cultured then the (witch) Sangeeta Bijlani that he has married. Whereas Janaab Sunil Dutt (a Hindu) remained faithful to his wife Nargis (a devout Muslimah) throughout his life and did a lot of khidmat (service, care) for her while she was ill with cancer. She lived and died like a true Muslimah. She was never forced to convert to Hinduism by Sunil Dutt. 
</p><p>Islam appeals to corrupt men like Dharmendra (a famous actor in India) who converted to it and use Islam to have two wives. I am still worried about my sisters who are about to get married in a couple of years time according to Muslim marriage laws that will be prevalent in India as the Mullahs here are hell bent upon making these laws more and more anti-woman rather than man-woman harmonius relationship-oriented. The Mullahs are also demanding Qazi courts (sharia courts) to be given recognition, which in the end, will totally bar Muslim women from seeking justice through Indian laws in cases of extreme abuse and injustice under Muslim laws. My fiancee's first question to me was about whether I would dump her and marry another girl if I started liking another girl after I married her. It is of course easier to be tempted to give in to your baser nature when your religious laws also encourage disloyalty to your wife. 
</p><p>Recently a Muslim woman called Imrana was raped by her father-in-law, and when she went to the Mullahs for justice, they first rebuked her for making this matter public, and then accused her of low morals; and <i>then</i> ordered her to marry her father-in-law. What an embarrassing and shameful day it was for me in my office when my Hindu colleagues were discussing this incident and enquiring from me rather innocently if it was the norm in Muslim society? 
</p><p>Also disturbing is the arrival of rich old Arabs in the Hyderabad city of India who marry young Indian Muslim girls in connivance with the local Mullahs for a period of 15-30 days; after satisfying their lust using the Indians Muslim girls and enjoying the Indian hospitality, these Arabs divorce the girls after robbing them of their virginity and respect, and return to their lands as respectable grandfathers and fathers. Their shameful acts remain unknown to their own daughters and granddaughters of equal age back home. What is disturbing is that these Arabs are even rented out rooms that are located conveniently in the homes of these maulvies who perform these sham marriages. In some cases these marriages last only 24 hours. In reality, Islam promotes prostitution and the Mullahs are nothing but pimps. Very soon India might become the centre of legalized, sharia-approved prostitution; a Mecca of fornication sought by Muslim men mostly from the Arab world. 
</p><p>In the end I got my answers from your website <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Authors.htm">Faith Freedom - Articles</a> and saw many Muslim names there. I like that many of the articles are written by ex-Muslims rather than by Christians who can sometimes criticize something without knowing about it from personal experience. I want more and more ex-Muslims to write for your site, which I believe will lend more credibility to the fact that Islam is stifling the Muslims and hampering their progress in the 21st century. First of all a faith should allow the freedom of questioning and debate, which Islam does not allow. That's why I was humiliated and thrown out of the mosque despite having been a devout Muslim and doing my namaz prayers in the same mosque for the last 37 years. 
</p><p>My real hero is Janaab A.P.J. Abdul Kalaam who is a great Indian scientist and has been rightly honoured by the majority Hindu India by making him the president of India, rather than put to shame in front of the entire nation by the President of Pakistan himself and later put into house arrest like Janaab A.Q. Khan of Pakistan. My other heroes are Janaab Ali Sina (you), Janaab Shah Rukh Khan, Janaab Salman Khan, Janaab Zayed Khan, Janaab Javed Akhtar, Mohtarma Shabana Azmi, Janaab Sohail Ilyaasi, Janaab Salmaan Khursheed and many other moderate Indian Muslim personalities. Though I am not a Muslim anymore. 
</p><p>I need your teams' help in reaching out to all the Muslims of Indian origin through this site. 
</p><p>Allah (God) Haafiz.

<p>This is a great essay but I changed your name to Alim Sheikh for your own safety.

<p>Dear Janaab Ali Sina, 
</p><p>This is the truth, not an essay or fiction. 
</p><p>There is no need to change my name either as I am living in India (unlike Pakistan), here a lot of Muslims (almost in hundreds at a time) have already and openly converted back to Hinduism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Second_response_by_Ali_Sina">Second response by Ali Sina</span></h2>
<p>Islam must be eradicated if humanity is to survive. This must be done by the hand of Muslims themselves or better said, the ex-Muslims. 
</p><p>I always said that with each Muslim that sees the light and leaves Islam, we win a new ally and a soldier in this battle against darkness of ignorance. The miracle of this war is that our victory does not mean the defeat of our opponent but rather his victory too. In fact this is the victory for mankind. This is the victory of good over evil, of love over hate, or compassion over anger, of knowledge over ignorance. It is the victory of unity of mankind, and of course it is a major victory for womankind. 
</p><p>Four years ago I promised we would overcome this evil in few short decades. I said many of us would see the end of Islam in our own lifetime. I repeat that promise once again with more conviction than ever. The movement of ex-Muslims is growing exponentially. The reason our growth is exponential, is because each new enlightened soul becomes a lighthouse to others. Each Muslim who comes out of Islam, becomes a dedicated soldier who tries to save his loved ones and his own people leading them too out of this pit of darkness and ignorance. The power of exponential growth is astronomical. If you start with one and each year you double that number, in thirty years you surpass a billion. That is how powerful is exponential growth. Like an avalanche our movement is gaining momentum by day, because love is more powerful than hate and truth is more potent than all lies. 
</p><p>Three days ago I published Qadir's testimony, and several people wrote to him to congratulate him. He forwarded his correspondence to me. Here is one of them. I decided to share it with you because it is inspiring and heartening. But specially because I hope it will help those Muslims sitting over the fence to make the leap and join us. 
</p><p>Ali Sina

<p>Hi Qadir; 
</p><p>I am from India and was a forced Muslim, because of my ancestral lineage, but never believed a wee-bit in this barbaric religion and today I came across you viewpoints on FaithFreedom (Ali Sina Is my hero too)and the best part was when you openly confessed your true name to him ignoring the pseudonym he suggested to you (I still feel you should heed)proved that you are really very brave and focussed to eradicate this disease which is a blot on humanity, yes, all like-minded musies should shed this disease from the skin (like real Muslims do)and work towards just humanity. 
</p><p>Congratulations to you once again and wish that our fraternity grows faster and in abundance.
Please feel free to respond.
In Peace

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Response_from_Qadir_Sheikh_to_Azim">Response from Qadir Sheikh to Azim</span></h2>
<p>From: Kaafir &lt;kaafir786@gmail.com&gt; 
</p><p>Dear Azim Bhaijaan, 
</p><p>Thanks for appreciating my viewpoint and my plight. Today I feel free and part of human race. 
</p><p>I have now more sense of belonging to my ethnic community to my country and to the entire human race as a whole. Till yesterday, I used to look at world as &quot;them and us&quot;, Islamic and non-Islamic. I repent those moments when I felt good about any news of Muslims killing the non- Muslims. 
</p><p>Islam creates a living hell for people who follow it and the &quot;Jannat&quot; heaven that it describes where a jihadi goes after death sounds like a whorehouse. Allah is the eternal pimp who charges you the price of your life and the lives of innocent people as entry fee to this eternal whorehouse where you get 70 virgin houris, young boys as slaves and rivers flowing with wine.
</p><p>I have seen many burkha wearing Muslim women who are suffering from breathing disorders who have to wear these so as not to offend any Mullah on the street. The burkha hinders the free flow of fresh air around the face and is actually a portable prison, which rides on top of the women. It also serves to remind them of their slavery to their man and Islam. 
</p><p>It is thanks to the efforts of a person like Janaab Ali Sina that I am able to see the world in a fresh new perspective. It would also be interesting to see Iranians return to their original Persian culture. Without Islam the world would be a more varied, beautiful, liveable and interesting place, as God wanted it to be. This is the main belief of Hindus that &quot;diversity is part of God's scheme of running this universe&quot; and Islam kills that diversity. 
</p><p>Imagine a world full of only Muslims and all the world full of burkha wearing women, and then the world would be divided between shia's and sunni's. Do you think they will embrace each other? Do you think there will be no poor or rich? Do you think that there would be no crime? Do you think businesses would make more money and banks could be run using stupid Islamic banking laws? Do you think there will be no wars? In fact if we ex-Muslims do not bring these facts to the Muslims we will fail the humanity. We should start communicating with those Indian Muslims who are educated and have Internet access. 
</p><p>I am not at all supportive of western culture. I love my Indian way of life minus the virus of Islam inside my head. Islam is nothing but MHD = Mad human disease like MCD = Mad cow disease or CJD. I am free of this disease now and am trying to keep the future nasl (generation) free of this disease of destruction. 
</p><p>Please forward my email and my URL to all the Indians Muslims that you know. 
</p><p>God/Allah/Ishwar bless you.
</p><p>Qadir Sheikh (Kaafir786)
