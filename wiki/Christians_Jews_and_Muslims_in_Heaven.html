<p>To accept the interpretation of verse 2:62 presented by Ahmadis and apologists, would also mean having to accept the Qur'an contains a blatant contradiction. However, as most Muslims will already be aware, this is not a contradiction if one takes the doctrine of <a href='wiki/Abrogation.html' title='Abrogation'>abrogation</a> into consideration.

<p>The following are what the <a href='wiki/Tafsir.html' title='Tafsir'>Tafsir</a> and <a href='wiki/Fiqh.html' title='Fiqh'>Fiqh</a> literature have to say on verse 2:62 and its meaning.

<h4><span class='mw-headline' id='Tafsir_Ibn_Abbas'>Tafsir Ibn Abbas</span></h4>
<div class='quotes'>Then Allah went on to mention the believers among them, saying: (Lo! Those who believe) <b>in Moses and all the other prophets</b>, these earn their reward from their Lord in Paradise; they shall have no fear perpetually and they shall perpetually not grieve. It is said that this means that no fear will come upon them concerning torment in the future life nor will they grieve about anything they have left behind. And it is also said that this means: they shall have no fear when death is slain and hell is closed. <b>Then He mentioned those who did not believe in Moses or the other prophets, saying: (and those who are Jews) who deviated from the religion of Moses, (and Christians) those who became Christians</b> (and Sabaeans) a Christian sect whose members shave the middle of their heads, read the Gospel, worship the angels and say: &quot; our hearts have returned (saba'at) unto Allah &quot; , (whoever believeth) from amongst them (in Allah and the Last Day and does right) in that which is between them and their Lord, (surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve).<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=2&tAyahNo=62&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=2&tAyahNo=62&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2'>Surah 2 Ayah 62</a><br>Tafsir Ibn 'Abbas, trans.

<div class='quotes'>After Allah described the condition - and punishment - of those who defy His commands, fall into His prohibitions and transgress set limits by committing prohibited acts, <b>He stated that the earlier nations who were righteous and obedient received the rewards for their good deeds. This shall be the case, until the Day of Judgment. Therefore, whoever follows the unlettered Messenger and Prophet shall acquire eternal happiness</b> and shall neither fear from what will happen in the future nor become sad for what has been lost in the past. Similarly, Allah said,
<p>(No doubt! Verily, the Awliya' of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve) (10:62).
The angels will proclaim to the dying believers, as mentioned,
</p>
(Verily, those who say: &quot;Our Lord is Allah (alone),&quot; and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): &quot;Fear not, nor grieve!

</p><p><b>This statement by Ibn `Abbas indicates that Allah does not accept any deed or work from anyone, unless it conforms to the Law of Muhammad that is, after Allah sent Muhammad .

</p>
<b>When Allah sent Muhammad as the Last and Final Prophet and Messenger to all of the Children of Adam, mankind was required to believe in him, obey him and refrain from what he prohibited them; those who do this are true believers</b>. The Ummah of Muhammad was called `Mu'minin' (believers), because of the depth of their faith and certainty, and because they believe in all of the previous Prophets and matters of the Unseen.<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=371?option=com_content&task=view&id=371'>The Meaning of Mu'min, or Believer</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>

<h4><span class='mw-headline' id='Maariful_Quran'>Maariful Quran</span></h4>
<div class='quotes'>In order to dispel such a misgiving, the present verse lays down a general principle: no matter how a man has been behaving earlier, so long as he submits himself fully to the commandments of Allah in his beliefs and in his deeds both, he is acceptable to Allah, and will get his reward.  <b>It is obvious enough that after the revelation of  the  Holy  Qur'an,  which  is  the last  message  of  Allah, perfect obedience to Allah can only mean accepting Islam and following the Last Prophet Muhammad</b>.
<p>One might also ask why the verse mentions the Muslims, for if it is an invitation  to Islam, there is no  need to extend the invitation to those who have already accepted Islam. But if we keep in mind the richly concentrated style of the Holy Qur'an,and try to look beyond the literal sense of  the words  into the implications  and suggestions contained in the verse, we would find that the inclusion of  the Muslim factor has added a new dimension to the meaning.  It is es if a king should,in a similar situation,say that his laws are impartially applicable to all his subjects, and that whosoever obeys them shall receive his reward for obedience irrespective of whether he has earlier been a friend or a foe.

<b>We had better dispel another misunderstanding which is likely to arise from the wordings of the present verse -- and, which is actually being promoted by certain 'modernizers'. The verse mentions only two articles of  faith of  the Islamic creed -- faith in Allah and faith in the Day of Judgment.  This should not be taken to mean that in order to attain salvation it is enough to have faith only in Allah and in the Day of Judgment. Fcr, the Holy Qur'an  repeatedly declares that he who does not believe in the prophets, in angels and in the Books of Allah is not a Muslim</b>.  Faith in Allah is the first article in the Islamic creed, while faith in the Day of Judgment is the last.  By  mentioning  only these two, the verse  intends to say in a succinct manner  that it is necessary to have faith in all the articles of the creed, from the first to the last.  Moreover, it is through the prophets and the Books of Allah alone that man  can acquire any  knowledge  of  the  essence  and the attributes of Allah and of what is to happen on the Day of Judgment, while  the Books  of  Allah  are revealed to  the  prophets through  an angel.  So, it is not possible to have faith in Allah  and the Day  of Judgment until and unless one has faith in the angels, in the Books of Allah and in the prophets.<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://islamicstudies.info/maarif/surah2.htm'>Surah 2 Ayah 62</a><br>Maulana Mufti Mohammad Shafi, trans.

</p>
<div class='quotes'>23.Contrary to the flaccid fancies of some &quot;modernizers&quot; who are very happy with  themselves  over  their  &quot;liberalism&quot; and  &quot;tolerance&quot;, the  present verse does not open the way to salvation for each and every &quot;man of good will&quot; irrespective of  the creed he follows. If one reads the verse in its proper context and along with other relevant verses of the Holy Qur'an, one will easily see that the verse, in fact, promises salvation in the other world only  to those who accept  Islam.  It is  a n  invitation to  Islam extended to the Jews, the Christians, the Sabeans and, as a matter of fact, to the followers of all possible religions, and even to non-believers -- specific names only serve as examples.<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://islamicstudies.info/maarif/surah2.htm'>Surah 2 Ayah 62</a><br>Maulana Mufti Mohammad Shafi, trans.

<div class='quotes'><b><i>Some wrong headed and evil mongers</i> in our time have tried to deceive people arguing erroneously from this  ayah. They say that to achieve salvation one does not need to believe in the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and the two articles of faith discussed here i.e. belief in Allah (SWT) and in the hereafter, are enough for ones salvation</b>. On the other hand this ayah makes it clear that it is not giving the detail of all the articles of faith which one should believe in. Those are mentioned elsewhere at numerous places. In fact this ayah clarifies the misconception that the Jews had, that they are the chosen ones and only they would enter the Paradise. On the contrary Allah (SWT) says that your salvation does not depend upon your lineage or your race but on the basis whether you are righteous or not.
As far as the belief in Prophet Muhammad (SAW) is concerned, we would like to point out the fact that, in the sixth ruku of this surah, Allah (SWT) invites the Jews to accept Islam by believing in the Prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) in order to achieve salvation and eternal bliss. <b>So how can it be that the belief of a person is complete without believing in Prophet Muhammad (SAW). The context of this ayah clarifies that those people who were Jews, Christians or Sabians, and followed their own Prophet before the advent of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and they believed in Allah (SWT) and the hereafter, did righteous deeds will have their rewards from Allah (SWT). But once Allah (SWT) revealed Qur’an to Prophet Muhammad (SAW), it has become incumbent on a person to believe in him and the last revealed Book, along with other articles of faith</b>.<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://tanzeem.org/online/dorah/005-Al%20Baqara%2047-82.pdf'>Surah 2 Ayah 62</a><br>Dr. Israr Ahmed, Biyan-ul-Quran</div></div>
<h4><span class='mw-headline' id='Dawat_ul_Quran'>Dawat ul Quran</span></h4>
<div class='quotes'>Another very important point must be made clear here. <b>It would be wrong to interpret the verse as implying that salvation depends upon virtuous conduct alone</b>.According to such a view , one who observed one’s own religion, believed in Allah and the Hereafter and was righteous in deeds deserved salvation. <b>This interpretation, however is farthest from the teachings of Quran and amounts to introducing an unjustifiable change in it</b>. In this verse, the details of true belief, faith and righteous conduct are not being explained at all; they are mentioned in other places in Quran. <b>Allah recognizes no belief or faith which does not accept that Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) is the last prophet of Allah and Quran is his true (undistorted) book</b>. Without this belief, righteous conduct is of no avail because righteousness itself is determined by the observance of Muhammad’s shariah (pbuh). Quran is replete with such teachings, for example Surah-al-Baqarah has this as the central theme: it invites people to believe in revelation of the Quran and the prophethood of Muhammad(pbuh). This point is repeatedly stressed in many places in Quran, Allah says
<p>With Allah, the accepted religion is Islam (Al-e-Imran 19)
</p>
Any person who will seek any religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter (Al-e-Imran 85)<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://islamicstudies.info/dawat/surah2.htm'>Surah 2 Ayah 62</a><br>Shams Pirzada, Dawat ul Quran, trans.

<div class='quotes'>Suddi states that (2:62) was revealed about the former companions of Salman the Persian when he mentioned them to the Prophet, relating how they had been, saying, &quot;They used to pray, fast, and believe in you, and testify that you would be sent as a prophet.&quot; When he had finished praising them, <b>the Prophet replied, &quot;Salman, they are the denizens of hell,&quot; which came to discomfit Salman greatly, and so Allah revealed (2:62)</b>.
<p>The faith of the Jews was that of whoever adhered to the Torah and the sunna of Moses until the coming of Jesus. When Jesus came, whoever held fast to the Torah and the sunna of Moses without giving them up and following Jesus was lost.
</p><p>The faith of the Christians was that whoever adhered to the Gospel and precepts of Jesus, their faith was valid and acceptable until the coming of Muhammad. Those of them who did not then follow Muhammad and give up the sunna of Jesus and the Gospel were lost.
</p>
<b>The foregoing is not contradicted by the hadith relating that (2:62) was followed by Allah revealing (3:85), for the hadith merely confirms that no one's way or spiritual works are acceptable unless they conform to the Sacred Law of Muhammad, now that he has been sent with it</b>.

<h4><span class='mw-headline' id='Belief_in_Allah_alone'>Belief in Allah alone</span></h4>
<p>2:62 makes it necessary to believe in Allah. And according to the Qur'an, believing in Allah alone is mandatory. Thus, &quot;associating partners&quot; with Allah is a sin that will not be forgiven.
</p>
<div class='quotes'>Surely <b>Allah does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him</b>, and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever He pleases; and whoever associates anything with Allah, he devises indeed a great sin.<br> <div class='quotes_ref'><a href='wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html' title='Compendium of Muslim Texts'>Qur'an</a> <a rel='nofollow' class='external text' href='http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.048#004.048'>4:48</a></div></div>
<p>Belief in the Christian Trinity is considered to be &quot;associating partners&quot; with Allah (i.e. polytheism), and the Qur'an specifically and repeatedly damns these Christians to Hell as blasphemous &quot;disbelievers&quot;.
</p>

<h2><span class='mw-headline' id='Conclusion'>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>There are many verses in the Qur'an that label Christians and Jews as disbelievers, and numerous more that explicitly condemn them and other disbelievers to Hell. There is scholarly consensus on the fact that Christians and Jews are viewed by Islam as kafirs, because of &quot;the clear nature of the texts about this&quot;.
</p><p>If you read verse 2:62 in context, it is referring only to those Christians, Jews, and Sabiens who believed in the time of their own Prophet/Messenger.
</p><p>Each <a href='wiki/Revelation.html' title='Revelation'>Revelation</a> abrogated the previous. Thus, after the advent of Prophet Muhammad and Islam, no individual can make it into Paradise unless they accept Allah as God, Muhammad as his last Prophet and the Qur'an as Allah's final book of guidance.
</p><p>Therefore, the concept of Heavenly rewards in Islam are now exclusively offered to Muslims. Christians and Jews may believe in a single monotheistic god, but they do not believe in &quot;His Messenger&quot;. Thus they are destined for the &quot;burning fire&quot;.
</p><p>Additionally, the non-Muslims who do make it into Paradise will only be used as sex-slaves by believing men, Muslims who themselves will be spared hell-fire by Allah on the Day of Resurrection by making innocent Christians and Jews take their place and be thrown into Hell.
