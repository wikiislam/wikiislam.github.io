No one was injured in the 5:30 a.m. blast, which shattered every window on one side of the parsonage. The only occupants of the building, a couple sleeping in an upper-story bedroom on the opposite side of the building, were untouched. The pastor and his wife were abroad for their Christmas holidays at the time of the blast. The bombing of the Anglican church was one of five explosions set off in the port during the first 48 hours of 2001.

<div class="quotes">The families and Christian colleagues of three American missionaries murdered by an Islamist militant at the Jibla Baptist Hospital in southern Yemen have sent word to the assassin that they forgive him for what he did. Close friends on the hospital staff conveyed the message through an attorney to Abed Abdul Razak Kamel, 30, the self-confessed killer. Dr. Martha Myers, hospital administrator William Koehn and purchasing agent Kathleen Gariety were shot and killed by Kamel on the morning of December 30 at the hospital compound. Kamel indicated to government interrogators that by murdering missionaries, whom he accused of converting “dozens of Muslims” to Christianity, he had insured his entrance into heaven. On December 31, hundreds of Yemenis gathered at the hospital to pay their respects to the slain missionaries, while others lined the road for a half-mile outside the hospital gates. The Christian emphasis on forgiveness was woven through the funeral “thanksgiving” service celebrated in Jibla, as well as in memorial services held later in Sanaa and in churches in the United States.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2003/01-January/newsarticle_1765.html/">&quot;Colleagues of Slain Missionaries Pray for Murderer&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwatchmonitor.org%2F2003%2F01-January%2Fnewsarticle_1765.html%2F&date=2013-09-27?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwatchmonitor.org%2F2003%2F01-January%2Fnewsarticle_1765.html%2F&date=2013-09-27">archived</a>)</span><br> World Watch Monitor, January 13, 2003<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2003/01-January/newsarticle_1765.html/">http://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2003/01-January/newsarticle_1765.html/</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Colleagues+of+Slain+Missionaries+Pray+for+Murderer&rft.atitle=&rft.date=January+13%2C+2003&rft.pub=World+Watch+Monitor&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwatchmonitor.org%2F2003%2F01-January%2Fnewsarticle_1765.html%2F&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Non-Muslims_-_Yemen"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Suicide_car_bomber_attacks_a_group_of_Spanish_tourists_visiting_a_temple_in_central_Yemen.2C_killing_seven_Spaniards_and_two_Yemenis">Suicide car bomber attacks a group of Spanish tourists visiting a temple in central Yemen, killing seven Spaniards and two Yemenis</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">A suspected al-Qaida suicide bomber plowed his car Monday into a group of Spanish tourists visiting a temple linked to the ancient Queen of Sheba, killing seven Spaniards and two Yemenis in a part of Yemen known for its lawlessness.
<p>The attack came less than two weeks after the U.S. Embassy warned Americans to avoid the area, which until recent years was rarely visited by tourists because of frequent kidnappings of foreigners.
</p><p>Spain's Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said the attacker drove into the middle of a convoy transporting the Spanish tourists, killing seven and wounding five. Two Yemenis also died, according to Yemen's Interior Ministry.
</p><p>Witnesses reported seeing a car drive into the group of tourists on a road outside the site of the 3,000-year-old Queen of Sheba temple in the central province of Marib. The mangled remains of a four-wheel-drive vehicle could be seen on the side of a road, but it was unclear if the vehicle belonged to the bomber or the tourists.
</p><p>The Queen of Sheba temple, which is known in Yemen by its Arabic name, Balqis, is about 85 miles east of the capital, San`a.
</p><p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, but authorities linked the suicide bomber to al-Qaida. Yemen is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, and police said they had received information last month about a possible al-Qaida attack. They did not elaborate.
</p><p>The region is home to four powerful tribes with more than 70 branches and is known to be a hotbed of support for al-Qaida.
</p><p>About 100 foreigners have been kidnapped in the area since the 1990s. As a result, tourists are a rare sight, and solo travelers who want to go to Marib must drive there as part of a convoy escorted by armed soldiers.
</p>
But in recent years, the area had grown calmer and some tourists looking for an off-the-beaten path adventure have begun traveling to Marib, which was the capital of Saba, or Sheba, the mightiest kingdom of ancient Arabia<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/02/AR2007070200723_pf.html">&quot;Suicide Attacker Kills 9 at Yemen Temple&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2007%2F07%2F02%2FAR2007070200723_pf.html&date=2013-09-26?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2007%2F07%2F02%2FAR2007070200723_pf.html&date=2013-09-26">archived</a>)</span><br>Ahmed Al-hajj, Associated Press, July 2, 2007<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/02/AR2007070200723_pf.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/02/AR2007070200723_pf.html</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Suicide+Attacker+Kills+9+at+Yemen+Temple&rft.atitle=&rft.aulast=Ahmed+Al-hajj&rft.au=Ahmed+Al-hajj&rft.date=July+2%2C+2007&rft.pub=Associated+Press&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2007%2F07%2F02%2FAR2007070200723_pf.html&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Non-Muslims_-_Yemen"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>

<div class="quotes">Gunmen opened fire on a tourist convoy on Friday afternoon in the Hadramawt region in eastern Yemen, killing two Belgian women and two Yemeni drivers, Yemeni officials said.
<p>The attack was the first aimed at foreigners in Yemen since last summer, when a suicide car bomber attacked a group of tourists visiting a temple in central Yemen, killing eight Spaniards and two Yemenis.
</p><p>The bodies were being flown back to the capital, Sana, on Friday night.
</p><p>The attack took place in the Wadi Dawan district, about 180 miles east of Sana. Four gunmen waiting in a pickup truck near a speed bump along a rural road ambushed a four-car tourist convoy, said a tourism official who asked not to be identified. Two Belgians and one Yemeni were also wounded.
</p><p>The attackers then fled, said Nabeel al-Faqih, Yemen’s tourism minister.
</p><p>The area where the attack occurred, near a famous group of ancient multistory mud dwellings in the town of Shibam, is not considered especially dangerous. There have been kidnappings in the area, but they have subsided in recent years after a government crackdown.
</p>

Full Story
</p><p>Rabbi Yahia Yaish bin Yahia said he felt alienated in his own village after a Jewish teacher was gunned down Thursday by a suspected Muslim extremist.
</p><p>&quot;Raydah is no longer like the old days,&quot; he told The Associated Press outside his home in the village some 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the capital San'a. &quot;Raydah today is full of monsters.&quot;
</p><p>Bin Yahia is one of the roughly 400 remaining Jews still living in Yemen, mostly in Raydah.
</p><p>Yemen was once home to about 50,000 Jews in the early 1950s, but most emigrated to Israel.<br>. . .<br>
Bin Yahia, however, said Yemeni authorities have ignored complaints from the Jewish villagers about these death threats from their neighbors and described rising hostilities against the Jewish community in the village.
</p><p>He said people had thrown stones at his windows and Jews walking in the streets have been threatened.
</p><p>&quot;Some have even raised their guns to our chests and necks, to our women's and children's necks,&quot; he said.
</p><p>Moshe Yaish Nahari, a teacher at the village yeshiva, was gunned down on Thursday.
</p><p>Deputy head of security for the province, Ahmed Yahia al-Srihi, said a suspect has been arrested and arraigned before a prosecutor.
</p><p>Al-Srihi said the suspect has a criminal record and had killed his wife, and he described him as having &quot;extremist tendencies.&quot;
</p>
According to the official investigation, seen by the AP, the man confessed to killing Nahari as a way to get &quot;close to God.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D952IAO80.html">&quot;Yemeni rabbi: Jewish community threatened&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.highbeam.com%2Fdoc%2F1A1-D952IAO80.html&date=2013-09-27?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.highbeam.com%2Fdoc%2F1A1-D952IAO80.html&date=2013-09-27">archived</a>)</span><br>Ahmed Al-haj, Associated Press, December 14, 2008<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D952IAO80.html">http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1A1-D952IAO80.html</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Yemeni+rabbi%3A+Jewish+community+threatened&rft.atitle=&rft.aulast=Ahmed+Al-haj&rft.au=Ahmed+Al-haj&rft.date=December+14%2C+2008&rft.pub=Associated+Press&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.highbeam.com%2Fdoc%2F1A1-D952IAO80.html&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Non-Muslims_-_Yemen"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Moshe Yaish-Nahari, the brother of a prominent rabbi in Yemen was shot to death on Thursday in Rida, Yemen, located north of the capital Sana'a, the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported.
<p>Local sources said the suspected killer, Abed el-Aziz el-Abadi, a former MiG-29 pilot in Yemen's air force, has been apprehended and taken in for questioning.

Eyewitnesses told the newspaper that el-Abadi had confronted Nahari at the market in Rida, called out to him &quot;Jew, accept the message of Islam&quot; and then proceeded to open fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle.

<div class="quotes">A group of South Korean government officials and relatives of victims of a suicide bombing in Yemen narrowly escaped an attack themselves Wednesday in the Middle Eastern country.
<p><br>
A suicide bomber blew himself up on a road leading to Sana’a International Airport as the South Korean convoy passed by, police officials said.
</p><p>The attack took place as the convoy was leaving the al-Dailami military base for the airport. The bomber, who was killed in the attack, had been waiting outside the gate of the base.
</p><p>There were no other casualties in the attack. Police told DPA that the attacker apparently missed his target by triggering his explosive belt seconds after the convoy passed.
</p><p>South Korean investigators and diplomats were in the convoy, police said.

<div class="quotes">An al-Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility Sunday for shooting dead an American teacher in Yemen, saying he was a Christian missionary, a statement by the jihadist group said.

The victim ,who was the deputy director of a Swedish language center in the city 270 kilometers (173 miles) southwest of Sana’a, was shot dead in his car in the neighborhood of Sena.
</p><p>The U.S. embassy in Sana’a said it did not have information about the killing and was investigating.

Authorities move Jews from Saada to a safer neighborhood near the US embassy</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">A Jewish community leader in Yemen was stabbed to death at a Sanaa market on Tuesday by a Muslim assailant who accused him of witchcraft.
<p>Harun Yusuf Zindani, 50, was attacked at Saawan market near the US embassy in northeast Sanaa, according to his son, Yehya. The victim, who was stabbed in the neck and stomach, was taken to the hospital and later died of his wounds.
</p><p>Yehya said the attacker was a “well-known person who says my father has ruined him and cast a spell on him.&quot;
</p><p>The Jewish community in Yemen numbered some 60,000 in 1948, but had shrunk significantly in the years following the establishment of the State of Israel.
</p><p>The community continued to dwindle in subsequent decades and by the early 1990s it numbered only around 1,000 people. The elimination of a longstanding travel ban in 1993 sparked a fresh exodus.
</p><p>Today, barely 300 Jews remain in the Asian country.
</p><p>Zindani was originally from the northern province of Saada, where Zaidi Shiite rebels fought a bloody war against former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime.
</p>
Since 2007, authorities have moved members of the Jewish community from Saada to a safer neighborhood in the capital near the US embassy.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4232834,00.html">&quot;Yemen: Jewish community leader stabbed to death&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4232834,00.html&date=2012-06-03?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4232834,00.html&date=2012-06-03">archived</a>)</span><br>Roi Kais, Ynet News, May 22, 2012<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4232834,00.html">http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4232834,00.html</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Yemen%3A+Jewish+community+leader+stabbed+to+death&rft.atitle=&rft.aulast=Roi+Kais&rft.au=Roi+Kais&rft.date=May+22%2C+2012&rft.pub=Ynet+News&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ynetnews.com%2Farticles%2F0%2C7340%2CL-4232834%2C00.html&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Non-Muslims_-_Yemen"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
