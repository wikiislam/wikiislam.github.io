<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Testimony_of_Leaving_Islam">Testimony of Leaving Islam</span></h2>
<p>I was born in a devout Muslim family belonging to Sunni sect of Islam. I come from an Islamic country but currently I live in a western country. During every Ramadan I used to faithfully fast. During my University study, one of my subjects was Islamic Studies. My professor of the subject glorified Islam and taught all the good deeds of the prophet of Islam. I was taught that Quran is the perfect and the best book sent by God. Islam should be dominant and supersede all the religions of the world. However I realized that he never mentioned why the prophet was so violent and killed so many people. He never mentioned the numerous contradictions in the Quran. He was blowing the trumpet of how other people were converting to Islam but he was in a state of denial (just like most Muslims) with the fact that many Muslims were leaving Islam. 
</p><p>The Islamic teachings that I received were accepted totally by me in the beginning. I defended Islam at all costs. I hated anyone who criticized the prophet or Islam. However, when I read ‘23 Years of Prophet’ by Ali Dashti, and when I went through various web-sites like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.answering-islam.org/">Answering-islam.org</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/">Faithfreedom.org</a>, and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.prophetofdoom.net/">Prophetofdoom.net</a>, and had discussions with non-Muslims, I began to lift my head out of the sand. I started analysing the Quran and the Islamic teachings and I realized that the mullahs and the Islamic scholars were hoodwinking the Muslims. 
</p><p>From my childhood I hated violence in any form. To my utter dismay I found out that the Quran is full of violence. For example,Quran 8:12 (Hilali- Khan) states:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> 	(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels, &quot;Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/Quran/8/12/default.htm">Islam Awakened - Qur'an 8:12</a> (Hilali / Khan)  </div></div>
<p>I discussed this verse with the mullahs and they stated that I have taken it out of context. I replied that the whole Quran has no context and chronology in the first place. They told many lies to cover it up. They quoted the Meccan verse (By the way, non violent Meccan verses have been abrogated by violent Medina verses) that says he that: <i>&quot;killing a man is like killing the whole humanity, and he that saves a man is like saving the whole humanity.&quot;</i> (<a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.032#005.032">5:32</a>). However this whole verse had been plagiarized verbatim from Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Therefore the man was created singly, to teach that he who destroys one soul of a human being, the Scripture considers him as if he should destroy a whole world, and him who saves one soul of Israel, the Scripture considers him as if he should save a whole world.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/sanhedrin4.html">Mishna Sanhedrin 4:5</a>  </div></div>
<p>This Mishnah was present 400 years before Quran. Quran 8:39 (Hilali-Khan) states:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism: i.e. worshipping others besides Allah) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allah Alone (in the whole of the world). But if they cease (worshipping others besides Allah), then certainly, Allah is All-Seer of what they do. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://islamawakened.com/Quran/default.htm">Quran 8:39 - Hilali / Khan</a> </div></div>
<p>The context of this verse is not that Islam should dominate other religions but the only religion in the world and so Muslims should fight and annihilate all non-believers till there is only Islam in the whole world. This tenet of violence and killing made me to dislike Islam and leave it. 
</p><p>All Muslims say that Islam is a religion of peace, but I was thinking how this can be a religion of peace when it teaches to kill the non-believers by any method? Again, if any religion teaches to kill a believer if he/she leaves it, then it is not a religion but an evil cult. Islam teaches to kill its apostates. <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.089#004.089">4:89</a> emphatically states that all apostates in Islam should be killed. Many references in hadith show that ex-Muslims were killed and are to be killed. Hence, I realized that Islam is not a religion but an evil cult. 
</p><p>I was always for the equality of man and woman, but since Islam teaches opposite I had no option but to leave Islam. <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.034#004.034">4:34</a> recommends beating a disobedient wife. Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 9, Number 493 states:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Narrated Aisha: 
The things which annul prayer were mentioned before me (and those were): a dog, donkey and a woman. I said, ‘You have compared us (women) to donkeys and dogs.’<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/009-sbt.php#001.009.493#001.009.493">1:9:493</a> </div></div>
<p>Muslim Book 1 Number 142 quotes Muhammad the prophet saying:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> O womenfolk, you should ask forgiveness for I saw you in bulk among the dwellers of Hell.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/001-smt.php#001.0142#001.0142">1:142</a> </div></div>
<p>In Islam women are treated like animals with no freedom and equal rights. Three shots from the Divorce gun in the hand of Muslim man “Divorce, Divorce, Divorce” will condemn even the most obedient wife to a life of ignominy and suffering. In Quran there is no punishment for the greatest crime to womenfolk, which is rape. On the other hand if a woman gets raped she will never ever get justice unless she produces four witnesses, who have actually seen the penetration during this horrid episode. This is bizarre procedure to get the witnesses who silently enjoyed the rape scene like in a theatre, and remember that those four watchers should be perfect believers with long beards as well. 
</p><p>Another reason that I left Islam is that Quran is full of internal contradictions, scientific errors and historical blunders. Muslims claim that Quran is ‘a miracle of miracles.’ This statement is the most blatant and greatest lie ever told. Here are a few samples of contradictions in the Quran:

By the way, the transliterated name of Jesus in the Arabic Quran is Isa but even this is wrong because the name of Esau, brother of Jacob (Yaqub in Arabic) is Isa in Arabic. The correct transliterated name of Jesus in Arabic is Yasu. Isa (Esau) means ‘hairy’ and Yasu (Jesus) means ‘God saves.’ Muslims tell so many lies to cover up all internal contradictions, scientific errors and historical blunders in Quran. Any sane person can become sick of Muslim apologists’ deception and lies of ‘out of context,’ ‘bad translation’ and ‘Arabic Quran can not be translated’ to hide and conceal the contradictions in the Quran. </li></ul>
<p>I was taught to love Mohammad the prophet more than anybody and anything in the world. He was best of creation, and a mercy sent to the earth by Allah. All Muslims believe that Mohammad was faultless, sinless and perfect but <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/048-qmt.php#048.002#048.002">48:2</a>, <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/047-qmt.php#047.019#047.019">47:19</a>, <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/040-qmt.php#040.055#040.055">40:55</a> reveal that Allah told Mohammad to ask forgiveness for his faults and also for the sins that he would be committing in the future. Wherever Mohammad went, he showed no mercy to non-believers but tortured, raped serially, killed, assassinated and committed genocide. All Muslims have to say ‘peace be upon him’, whenever they mention the prophet’s name, but I discovered in the Quran, Sira (biography of the prophet) by Ishaq and all hadith that when he was weak, he tried to follow peace and endured all the scoffing and ridicule, but when he was strong and had a large horde of powerful militants and terrorists, he tore all the peace treaties into pieces and destroyed peace wherever he went. Even till today his followers the Mohammedans i.e. Muslims pretend to follow peace when they are weak but when they are strong they destroy peace and harmony. 
</p><p>Muslims tell don’t blaspheme Mohammad the prophet. Islamic countries have enacted blasphemy laws and they torture, imprison and kill innocent persons and minorities over trivial matter. The fact is that man cannot blaspheme man but he can only blaspheme God if he wants to do so. If a person is accused of blaspheming someone then that someone is God. The politically correct western governments and the toothless UNO are doing nothing to protest against these diabolic and wicked blasphemy laws concerning a dead man called Mohammed. Mohammedans i.e. Muslims say Mohammad was a man yet they treat him like or equal to God. Quran 4:80 (Hilali-Khan) tells:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> <b>He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), has indeed obeyed Allah</b>, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad SAW) as a watcher over them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/Quran/4/80/default.htm">Islam Awakened - Qur'an 4:80</a> (Hilali / Khan)</div></div>
<p>This verse reveals Mohammad is equal to Allah. Quran 33:56 (Palmer) says:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Verily, God and His angels pray for the prophet. O ye who believe! pray for him and salute him with a salutation! <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.quranbrowser.com/">Quran 33:56 - Palmer</a> </div></div>
<p>The above verse shows that Mohammad is greater than Allah because God does not pray for man. The arabic word used in 33:56 is ‘yusalloo’ which means pray. But other translators of Quran deceitfully translate ‘yusalloo’ as bless. But when the same word ‘yusalloo’ is used in <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.102#004.102">4:102</a> those translators translate it as pray and not as bless. Hence, one sees the deceitfulness of the translators here. <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/049-qmt.php#049.002#049.002">49:2</a> - 4 and <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/033-qmt.php#033.053#033.053">33:53</a> reveal that Allah is acting lower in rank to prophet - that is, like a servant to Mohammad because Allah tells the believers to lower their voice and not to talk loudly in the presence of prophet; not to tarry long in prophet’s house and to talk to his wives only from behind the curtain and the prophet is embarrassed to tell you this but Allah is not. 
</p><p>Any unbiased man and person with common sense can understand from the above Quranic verses that the author of Quran is not Allah but Mohammad who made himself equal to or sometimes greater than God. Tabari (contains Islamic hadith chronologically) IX: 187 states “Bakr saw that Umar would not listen. He went forward. ‘Those people who formerly worshipped Muhammad must know that the deity you worshipped is dead.’ ” Though Islam teaches monotheism yet some verses of Quran and Hadith and Muslims by their actions support and are guilty of dual theism (Allah and Mohammad), prophetaltry (worship of prophet) and Quranaltry (worship of the Quran). Since Muslims treat Mohammad like or equal to God, I quit Islam forever.
</p><p>At present I love the message of Lord Jesus who taught love, fraternity and peace in all his teachings. His entire message is love for humanity. Lord Christ died on the cross for the sins of humanity and was resurrected, to save the world. He never ever killed any human but only healed and saved all whereas Mohammad the prophet tortured and killed many. I would not like to even compare Lord Christ’s teachings with the Islamic nonsense of violence, looting, plundering, killing, enslaving and raping the non-believers.
</p><p>I wish that my testimony could open the eyes of other Muslims, who like to live in harmony with non-Muslims, lift their heads out of the sand and quit the cult of Islam. A caveat to Muslims that are brain dead zombies: my testimony is not fake and do not deceive yourselves that no Muslim will leave Islam because Muslims are quitting Islam by scores. All westerners, liberals, leftists, rightists, media personnel, political leaders, government officials and non-Muslims, remember you are all kafirs destined to be killed and burn forever in hell according to Islam. So please unite, stop being politically correct, help to stop the immigration flooding of Muslims to western countries and don’t be deceived by Islam. Because both types of Muslims, that is, Islamic terrorists who use jihad, bombing and explosions and so-called Muslim moderates who use deception, conversion techniques, and mass population explosions by birth and immigration to western countries, are both trying very hard to achieve the same goal, which is to fulfill <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/008-qmt.php#008.039#008.039">8:39</a> which states there should be only one religion (Islam) for Allah in the whole world.
