<p>Muslims often claim lying in Islam is restricted to its use in war, but in the following hadiths, Muhammad permits a Muslim to lie in order to kill Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a Jewish poet who wrote an anti-Muslim poem which offended him.

Would you like that I kill him?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes,&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &quot;Then allow me to say a (false) thing (i.e. to deceive Kab). &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;You may say it.&quot;</b> Then Muhammad bin Maslama went to Kab and said, &quot;That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e. Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from you.&quot; On that, Kab said, &quot;By Allah, you will get tired of him!&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &quot;Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or two of food.&quot; (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab said, &quot;Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.&quot; Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, &quot;What do you want?&quot; Ka'b replied, &quot;Mortgage your women to me.&quot; They said, &quot;How can we mortgage our women to you and you are the most handsome of the 'Arabs?&quot; Ka'b said, &quot;Then mortgage your sons to me.&quot; They said, &quot;How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would be abused by the people's saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you.&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He came to Kab at night along with Kab's foster brother, Abu Na'ila. Kab invited them to come into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, &quot;Where are you going at this time?&quot; Kab replied, &quot;None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster) brother Abu Na'ila have come.&quot; His wife said, &quot;I hear a voice as if dropping blood is from him, Ka'b said. &quot;They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if invited to be killed.&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators mention the men as 'Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, &quot;When Ka'b comes, I will touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him. I will let you smell his head.&quot; Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama said. &quot; have never smelt a better scent than this. Ka'b replied. &quot;I have got the best 'Arab women who know how to use the high class of perfume.&quot; Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka'b &quot;Will you allow me to smell your head?&quot; Ka'b said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Muhammad smelt it and made his companions smell it as well. <b>Then he requested Ka'b again, &quot;Will you let me (smell your head)?&quot; Ka'b said, &quot;Yes.&quot; When Muhammad got a strong hold of him, he said (to his companions), &quot;Get at him!&quot; So they killed him and went to the Prophet and informed him.

<p>In addition to Sahih Bukhari, we find a narration in Sahih Muslim concerning Muhammad permitting a Muslim to lie in order to kill Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a Jewish poet who wrote an anti-Muslim poem which offended him. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">It has been narrated on the authority of Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who will kill Ka'b b. Ashraf? He has maligned Allah, the Exalted, and His Messenger. Muhammad b. Maslama said: Messenger of Allah, do you wish that I should kill him? He said: Yes. He said: <b>Permit me to talk (to him in the way I deem fit). He said: Talk (as you like)</b>. So, Muhammad b. Maslama came to Ka'b and talked to him, referred to the old friendship between them and said: This man (i. e. the Holy Prophet) has made up his mind to collect charity (from us) and this has put us to a great hardship. When be heard this, Ka'b said: By God, you will be put to more trouble by him. Muhammad b. Maslama said: No doubt, now we have become his followers and we do not like to forsake him until we see what turn his affairs will take. I want that you should give me a loan. He said: What will you mortgage? He said: What do you want? He said: Pledge me your women. He said: You are the most handsome of the Arabs; should we pledge our women to you? He said: Pledge me your children. He said: The son of one of us may abuse us saying that he was pledged for two wasqs of dates, but we can pledge you (cur) weapons. He said: All right. Then Muhammad b. Maslama promised that he would come to him with Harith, Abu 'Abs b. Jabr and Abbad b. Bishr. So they came and called upon him at night. He came down to them. Sufyan says that all the narrators except 'Amr have stated that his wife said: I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder. He said: It is only Muhammad b. Maslama and his foster-brother, Abu Na'ila. When a gentleman is called at night even it to be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call. Muhammad said to his companions: As he comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: <b>We sense from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So he caught it and smelt. Then he said: Allow me to do so (once again). He then held his head fast and said to his companions: Do your job.

<div class="quotes"><b>Question:</b>
<p>In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful
</p><p>Peace, blessings and mercy of Allah be upon you.
</p><p>My father has an illicit relationship with a woman other than my mother and he refuses to marry her and he spends on her abundantly, and at the same time, he is tightfisted on his house. My mother knew what he spends on her, without his knowledge, through reading a list he keeps in his pocket. She used tricks to make sedition between them by claiming that someone called us and said that he spent that sum and that sum on that woman. My father asked my testimony and I supported my mother’s claim. Are my mother and I sinful by lying on my father, or is it considered “permissible” lying? How do you counsel us to solve this problem? Jazakum Allahu Khairan.
</p><p><b>Answer:</b>
</p><p>In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful
</p><p>Praise be to Allah, prayers and peace be upon His kind Messenger, his family members, companions and followers.
</p><p>Lying is a grave sin and a bad conduct that should not be resorted to by anyone who believes in Allah and in the Day of Judgment, <b>except under the compelling strokes of necessity</b>, because, as the prophet, prayers and peace of Allah be upon him, said: “That lying leads to dissolution, and that dissolution leads to hellfire, and a person is always lying and seeks lying until he is registered unto Allah that he is a liar”. If someone is compelled to lying, <b>he can indirectly say something that his listener can understand something else</b>. However, your father should be reached out by a sincere advice that he should fear Allah and that his relationship with that woman is against his reputation, his old age, and his religion, that would expose him to Allah’s wrath and contempt.

As for your mother, it would be better for her that she would approach your father in their privacy and tell him that she knows what is going on between him and that woman, and that she is patient on that situation in consideration for the family and intimate ties between them and that her patience has reached a warning limit of no more if he goes on like this, and that she reminds him of Allah and frightens him of His wrath and contempt, that he may come back to his senses and sincerely repent to Allah.

<div class="quotes">Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
<dl><dd>In this verse [al-Maa’idah 5:51] Allaah tells us that whoever takes the Jews and Christians as friends is one of them because of his taking them as friends... [Aal ‘Imraan 3:28] </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This verse explains all the verses quoted above which forbid taking the kaafirs as friends in general terms. What that refers to is in cases where one has a choice, but <b>in cases of fear and taqiyah it is permissible to make friends with them</b>, as much as is essential to protect oneself against their evil. That is subject to the condition that one’s faith should not be affected by that friendship and the one who is behaves in that manner out of necessity is not one who behaves in that manner out of choice. </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>It may be understood from the apparent meaning of these verses that the one who deliberately takes the kuffaar as friends by choice and because he likes them, is one of them.</dd></dl>
<p>Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 2/98,99 <br>. . .<br>
</p><p>Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on mixing with the kuffaar and treating them kindly hoping that they will become Muslim. He replied:  
</p>
<dl><dd><b>Undoubtedly the Muslim is obliged to hate the enemies of Allaah and to disavow them</b>, because this is the way of the Messengers and their followers. [Quotes al-Mumtahanah 60:4 &amp; al-Mujaadilah 58:22]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Based on this, it is not permissible for a Muslim to feel any love in his heart towards the enemies of Allaah who are in fact his enemies too. [Quotes al-Mumtahanah 60:1]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>But if a Muslim treats them with kindness and gentleness in the hope that they will become Muslim and will believe, there is nothing wrong with that</b>, because it comes under the heading of opening their hearts to Islam. But <b>if he despairs of them becoming Muslim, then he should treat them accordingly</b>. This is something that is discussed in detail by the scholars, especially in the book Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him).</dd></dl>

<div class="quotes">The Arabic word tawriyah [translated here as deliberate ambiguity] means to conceal something.
<p>Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): [Quotes al-Ma'idah 5:31 &amp; al-A’raaf 7:26] 
</p><p>With regard to the meaning in sharee’ah (religious) terminology, it refers to someone who says something that may appear to have one meaning to the listener but the speaker intends something different that may be understood from these words. For example, he says, “I do not have a dirham in my pocket,” and that is understood to mean that he does not have any money at all, when what he means is that he does not have a dirham but he may have a dinar, for example. This is called ambiguity or dissembling. 
</p><p><b>Deliberate ambiguity is regarded as a legitimate solution for avoiding difficult situations that a person may find himself in when someone asks him about something, and he does not want to tell the truth on the one hand, and does not want to lie, on the other.</b> 
</p><p><b>Deliberate ambiguity is permissible if it is necessary or if it serves a shar’i (religious) interest</b>, but it is not appropriate to do it a great deal so that it becomes a habit, or to use it to gain something wrongfully or to deprive someone of his rights.  
</p><p>Al-Nawawi said: 
</p><p>The scholars said: If that is needed to serve some legitimate shar’i interest that outweighs the concern about misleading the person to whom you are speaking, or it is needed for a reason that cannot be achieved without lying, then there is nothing wrong with using deliberate ambiguity as an acceptable alternative. But if there is no interest to be served and no pressing need, then it is makrooh (disliked), but is not haram (impermissible). If it is a means of taking something wrongfully or depriving someone of their rights, then it is haram in that case. This is the guideline in this matter. Al-Adhkaar. 
</p><p>Some scholars were of the view that it is haram to resort to deliberate ambiguity if there is no reason or need to do so. This was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). See al-Ikhtiyaaraat. 
</p><p><b>There are situations in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught that we may use deliberate ambiguity</b>, for example: 
</p><p>If a man loses his wudoo (ablution) whilst praying in congregation, what should he do in this embarrassing situation? 
</p><p>The answer is that he should place his hand over his nose and leave. 
</p><p>The evidence for that is the report narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If anyone of you breaks his wudoo whilst praying, let him hold his nose and leave.” Sunan Abi Dawood. 
</p><p>Al-Teebi said: The command to hold his nose is so that it will look as if he has a nosebleed. This is not a lie, rather it is a kind of ambiguity. This concession is granted so that the Shaytan will not trick him into staying put because of feeling embarrassed in front of people. 
</p><p>Mirqaah al-Mafaateeh Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh. 
</p><p>This is a kind of ambiguity that is permitted, so as to avoid any embarrassment and so that whoever sees him leaving will think that he has a nosebleed.
</p><p><b>Similarly If a Muslim faces a difficult situation where he needs to say what is against the truth in order to protect himself or someone who is innocent, or to save himself from serious trouble, is there a way for him to escape the situation without lying or falling into sin?</b>
</p><p><b>Yes, there is a legal way and a permissible escape that one can make use of if necessary. It is equivocation or indirectness in speech. Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) entitled a chapter of his Saheeh: “Indirect speech is a safe way to avoid a lie”. (Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitaab al-Adab (Book of Manners)).</b>
</p><p>Equivocation means saying something which has a closer meaning that the hearer will understand, but it also has a remote meaning which what is actually meant and is linguistically correct. The condition for this is that whatever is said should not present a truth as falsity and vice versa. <b>The following are examples of such statements used by the salaf (pious predecessors) and early imams (religious leaders), and collected by Imam Ibn al-Qayyim in his book Ighaathat al-Lahfaan</b>:
</p><p>It was reported about Hammad (may Allah have mercy on him), if someone came that he did not want to sit with, he would say as if in pain: “My tooth, my tooth!” Then the boring person whom he did not like would leave him alone.
</p><p>Imam Sufyan Al-Thawri was brought to the khaleefah al-Mahdi, who liked him, but when he wanted to leave, the khaleefah told him he had to stay. Al-Thawri swore that he would come back. He then went out, leaving his shoes at the door. After some time he came back, took his shoes and went away. The khaleefah asked about him, and was told that he had sworn to come back, so he had come back and taken his shoes.
</p><p>Imam Ahmad was in his house, and some of his students, including al-Mirwadhi, were with him. Someone came along, asking for al-Mirwadhi from outside the house, but Imam Ahmad did not want him to go out, so he said: “Al-Mirwadhi is not here, what would he be doing here?” whilst putting his finger in the palm of his other hand, and the person outside could not see what he was doing.
</p><p><b>Other examples of equivocation or indirectness in speech include the following:</b>
</p><p>If someone asks you whether you have seen so-and-so, and you are afraid that if you tell the questioner about him this would lead to harm, you can say “ma ra aytuhu”, meaning that you have not cut his lung, because this is a correct meaning in Arabic [“ma ra aytuhu” usually means “I have not seen him,” but can also mean “I have not cut his lung”]; or you could deny having seen him, referring in your heart to a specific time and place where you have not seen him. If someone asks you to swear an oath that you will never speak to so-and-so, you could say, “Wallaahi lan ukallumahu”, meaning that you will not wound him, because “kalam” can also mean “wound” in Arabic [as well as “speech”]. Similarly, if a person is forced to utter words of kufr (disbelief) and is told to deny Allah, it is permissible for him to say “Kafartu bi’l-laahi”, meaning “I denounce the playboy” [which sounds the same as the phrase meaning “I deny Allah.”]
</p><p>(Ighaathat al-Lahfaan by Ibn al-Qayyim. See also the section on equivocation (ma’aareed) in Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih).
</p><p>However, one should be cautious that the use of such statements is restricted only to situations of great difficulty, otherwise:
</p><p>Excessive use of it may lead to lying.
</p><p>One may lose good friends, because they would always be in doubt as to what is meant.
</p><p>If the person to whom such a statement is given comes to know that the reality was different from what he was told, and he was not aware that the person was engaging in deliberate ambiguity or equivocation, he would consider that person to be a liar. This goes against the principle of protecting one’s honour by not giving people cause to doubt one’s integrity.
</p><p>The person who uses such a technique frequently may become proud of his ability to take advantage of people.

<div class="quotes"><i>&quot;(3:28) The believers may not take the unbelievers for their allies in preference to those who believe. Whoever does this has nothing to do with Allah unless he does so in order to protect himself from their wrong-doing...&quot;</i>
<p>This means that it is lawful for a believer, helpless in the grip of the enemies of Islam and in imminent danger of severe wrong and persecution, to keep his faith concealed and <b>to behave in such a manner as to create the impression that he is on the same side</b> as his enemies. A person whose Muslim identity is discovered is permitted to adopt a friendly attitude owards the unbelievers in order to save his life. If he considers himself incapable of enduring the excesses to which he may be subjected, he may even state that he is not a believer.
</p><p><i>&quot;...Allah warns you to beware of Him for it is to Allah that you will return.&quot;</i>
</p>
One should not be overwhelmed by the fear of other human beings to the extent of losing the fear of God. Human beings can harm a man but the most they can do is to ruin his transient, earthly life. God, on the other hand, can subject him to everlasting torment. If one is constrained in extraordinary circumstances to resort to a prudent <b>concealment of faith (taqiyah)</b> in order to save one's life, this concealment should remain within reasonable limits. The most one is permitted to do is to protect one's life and property without jeopardizing either the interests of Islam or of the Muslim community as a whole, and without causing loss of life and property to other Muslims. One must never allow saving one's own life to lead to the propagation of unbelief at the expense of Islam and to the dominance of unbelievers over Muslims. Here the believers are warned that, no matter how dangerous the circumstances surrounding them, they cannot escape God's reproach if they give substantial aid to those rebelling against Him, and cause any harm to God's chosen religion, to the community of believers or to any individual believer. For, it is to God that one will ultimately return for reckoning.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.islamicstudies.info%2Ftafheem.php%3Fsura%3D3%26verse%3D21%26to%3D30&date=2013-06-07?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.islamicstudies.info%2Ftafheem.php%3Fsura%3D3%26verse%3D21%26to%3D30&date=2013-06-07">Surah 3 Ayah 28</a><br>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, Tafhim al-Qur'an</div></div>
