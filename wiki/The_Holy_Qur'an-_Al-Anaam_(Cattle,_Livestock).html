</p><p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:1"> <sup>1</sup></span>
Praise be Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet those who reject Faith hold (others) as equal, with their Guardian-Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:2"> <sup>2</sup></span>
He it is created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term (for you). And there is in His presence another determined term; yet ye doubt within yourselves!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:3"> <sup>3</sup></span>
And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth. He knoweth what ye hide, and what ye reveal, and He knoweth the (recompense) which ye earn (by your deeds).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:4"> <sup>4</sup></span>
But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them, but they turned away therefrom.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:5"> <sup>5</sup></span>
And now they reject the truth when it reaches them: but soon shall they learn the reality of what they used to mock at.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:6"> <sup>6</sup></span>
See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?—generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We
have not given to you — for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:7"> <sup>7</sup></span>
If We had sent unto thee a written (message) on parchment, so that they could touch it with their hands, the Unbelievers would have been sure to say: &quot;This is nothing but obvious magic!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:8"> <sup>8</sup></span>
They say: &quot;Why is not an angel sent down to him?&quot; If we did send down an angel, the matter would be settled at once, and no respite would be granted them.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:9"> <sup>9</sup></span>
If We had made it an angel, We should have sent him as a man, and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:10"> <sup>10</sup></span>
Mocked were (many) messengers before thee; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:11"> <sup>11</sup></span>
Say: &quot;Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:12"> <sup>12</sup></span>
Say: &quot;To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?&quot; Say: &quot;To Allah. He hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) Mercy. That He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment, there is no doubt whatever. It is they who have lost their own souls, that will not believe.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:13"> <sup>13</sup></span>
&quot;To him belongeth all that dwelleth (or lurketh) in the night and the day. For he is the one who heareth and knoweth all things.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="6:14"> <sup>14</sup></span>
Say: &quot;Shall I take for my protector any other than Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth?
