What do you say about it?&quot; He let me appear before the people and I said, &quot;O Chief of the Believers! You have the chiefs of the army staff and the nobles of the Arabs. If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&quot; He said, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&quot; He replied, &quot;No.&quot; I said, &quot;By Allah, Allah's Apostle never killed anyone except in one of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&quot; Then the people said, &quot;Didn't Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah's Apostle cut off the hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&quot; I said, &quot;I shall tell you the narration of Anas.
