I asked Ibn 'Umar, &quot;(What is the verdict if) a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse?&quot; Ibn 'Umar said, &quot;The Prophet separated (by divorce) the couple of Bani Al-Ajlan, and said, (to them), 'Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?'

So he separated them by divorce.&quot; (Aiyub, a sub-narrator said: 'Amr bin Dinar said to me, &quot;There is something else in this Hadith which you have not mentioned. It goes thus: '<b>The man said, 'What about my money (i.e. the Mahr that I have given to my wife)?' It was said, 'You have no right to restore any money, for if you have spoken the truth (as regards the accusation), you have also consummated your marriage with her'</b>; and if you have told a lie, you are less rightful to have your money back.' &quot;) <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/063-sbt.php#007.063.231#007.063.231">7:63:231</a> </div></div>

I asked Ibn 'Umar about those who were involved in a case of Lien. He said, &quot;The Prophet said to those who were involved in a case of Lien, 'Your accounts are with Allah. One of you two is a liar, and you (the husband) have no right over her (she is divorced).&quot; '<b>The man said, 'What about my property (Mahr) ?'

The Prophet rode and Abu Talha rode too and I was riding behind Abu Talha. The Prophet passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly and my knee was touching the thigh of the Prophet . He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, 'Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.' He repeated this thrice. The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, 'Muhammad (has come).' (Some of our companions added, &quot;With his army.&quot;) We conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, 'O Allah's Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.' The Prophet said, 'Go and take any slave girl.' He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, 'O Allah's Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.' So the Prophet said, 'Bring him along with her.' So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, he said to Dihya, 'Take any slave girl other than her from the captives.'

AbuDawud said: This tradition has been narrated by AbdurRahman ibn Mahdi, from Salih ibn Ruman, from AbuzZubayr on the authority of Jabir as his own statement (not going back to the Prophet). It has also been transmitted by AbuAsim from Salih ibn Ruman , from AbuzZubayr on the authority of Jabir who said: During the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) we used to <b>contract temporary marriage for a handful of grain</b>. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/011-sat.php#011.2105#011.2105">11:2105</a>  </div></div>

<p>Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that when asked whether it was permissible for a man to return to his wife if he had divorced her irrevocably and then another man had married her after him and died before consummating the marriage, al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said, &quot;It is not halal for the first husband to return to her.&quot;
</p>
Malik said, about the muhallil, that he could not remain in the marriage until he undertook a new marriage.

<p>Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Said ibn al-Musayyab and from Sulayman ibn Yasar that Tulayha al-Asadiya was the wife of Rushayd ath-Thaqafi. He divorced her, and she got married in her idda-period. Umar ibn al-Khattab beat her and her husband with a stick several times, and separated them. Then Umar ibn al-Khattab said, &quot;If a woman marries in her idda-period, and the new husband has not consummated the marriage, then separate them, and when she has completed the idda of her first husband, the other becomes a suitor. If he has consummated the marriage then separate them. Then she must complete her idda from her first husband, and then the idda from the other one, and they are never to be reunited.&quot;
</p><p>Malik added, <i>Said ibn al-Musayyab said that '<b>she had her dowry because he had consummated the marriage.&quot;'</b></i>
</p>
Malik said,&quot;The practice with us concerning a free woman whose husband dies, is that she does an idda of four months and ten days and she does not marry if she doubts her period until she is free of any doubt or if she fears that she is pregnant.&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Al-Muwatta</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muwatta/028-mmt.php#028.28.11.27#028.28.11.27">28 11.27</a> </div></div>

<div class="quotes">Q: He completed the marriage contract with her, then he died. He had  already given her a part of   the mahr, and he has other debts besides the mahr. What should the heirs do with regard to the remaining part of the mahr?

</p><p>We put his question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows: 
</p><p>The remaining part of the mahr should be included with the other debts, and whatever was given to her (the bride) previously belongs to her. And Allaah knows best.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_their_country_the_husband_is_given_a_dowry">In their country the husband is given a dowry</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allaah. 
<p>In His Holy Book, Allaah has commanded men to give their wives their dowries.<br>. . .<br>
Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
</p><p>This indicates that the mahr is essential in marriage, because he said: “Do you have anything that you could give to her as a dowry?” The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for anyone to engage in intimacy (with a woman) without naming the mahr. 
</p><p>It also indicates that it is better to name the mahr. If a marriage contract is done without naming the mahr, the marriage is valid and the bride is entitled to a mahr like that of other women like her, when the marriage is consummated.  
</p><p>Fath al-Baari, 9/211. 
</p><p>The Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars indicate that the dowry is to be given by the man to the woman, not vice versa. This is what is in accordance with sound human nature. How can a man be qawwaam (in charge of) the woman when she is the one who has paid the mahr to him?<br>. . .<br>
This money that the woman gives to the man as a dowry to him for marrying her is contrary to Islam, to the fitrah, to reason and to human nature. This applies even if it is a little, so how about the amounts that you mention?! 
</p><p>As for the solution, it is essential that the scholars, daa’iyahs and media in your country strive their utmost to put an end to this problem and then deal with it and change the custom to that which is in accordance with sharee’ah, which is in accordance with the nature which Allaah has created in man. 
</p>
And Allaah knows best.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/45527/mahr&date=2011-04-22?url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/45527/mahr&date=2011-04-22">In their country the husband is given a dowry!</a><br>Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 45527</div></div>
