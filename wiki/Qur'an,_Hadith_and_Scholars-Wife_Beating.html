<div class="quotes"><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. <b>As to those women on whose part ye <i>fear</i> disloyalty and ill-conduct</b>, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) <b>beat them</b> (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all). 
<p><b>Pickthall:</b> Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. <b>As for those from whom ye <i>fear</i> rebellion</b>, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and <b>scourge them</b>. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is ever High, Exalted, Great.

<b>Shakir:</b> Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and <b>(as to) those on whose part you <i>fear</i> desertion</b>, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and <b>beat them</b>; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.034#004.034">4:34</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">... He (Muhammad b. Qais) then reported that it was 'A'isha who had narrated this: Should I not narrate to you about myself and about the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? We said: Yes. She said: When it was my turn for Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) to spend the night with me, he turned his side, put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed them near his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay down till he thought that I had gone to sleep. He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened the door and went out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head, put on my veil and tightened my waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi'. He stood there and he stood for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned. He hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran. He came (to the house) and I also came (to the house). I, however, preceded him and I entered (the house), and as I lay down in the bed, he (the Holy Prophet) entered the (house), and said: Why is it, O 'A'isha, that you are out of breath?

The warning could be to tell her, &quot;fear Allah concerning the rights you owe to me,&quot; or it could be to explain that rebelliousness nullifies his obligation to support her and give her a turn amongst other wives, or it could be to inform her, &quot;Your obeying me is religiously obligatory&quot;).

<div class="quotes">Allaah has enjoined woman to be obedient to her husband, and has made men qawwaamoon (protectors and maintainers) of women. They are supposed to direct and look after women as a leader directs and looks after his people, because of the physical and mental characteristics with which Allaah has distinguished them, as well as the financial duties that He has enjoined upon them...<br><br>
If the wife goes against his wishes and refuses to obey him, the husband has to take a gradual approach in handling the matter. First he should admonish her and remind her of the punishment for disobeying his command. If that does not succeed, then he moves on to forsaking her in bed. If that does not work, then he may hit her, but in a manner that is not severe, and there is nothing wrong with also threatening her with divorce...<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/49945">His wife does not cover her hands – should he threaten to divorce her?</a><br>Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 49945</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Discipline. The husband has the right to discipline his wife if she disobeys him in something good, not if she disobeys him in something sinful, because Allaah has enjoined disciplining women by forsaking them in bed and by hitting them, when they do not obey.  
The Hanafis mentioned four situations in which a husband is permitted to discipline his wife by hitting her. These are: not adorning herself when he wants her to; not responding when he calls her to bed and she is taahirah (pure, i.e., not menstruating); not praying; and going out of the house without his permission. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/10680/rights%20husband%20wife">What are the rights of the husband and what are the rights of the wife?</a><br>Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid, Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 10680</div></div>
<div class="quotes">One of the husband's rights is to discipline his wife if she is disobedient. What does the word 'disobedience' mean? Disobedience is to leave the house without the husband's permission, to refuse to obey the husband in bed, to speak to the husband impolitely, or to do the opposite of what he likes. All these are forms of disobedience...<br>
<p>Okay, he's tried admonishing, he's tried banishment - but nothing. Her emotions are numb, and she says: Good riddance. So what is the next measure? &quot;...and beat them.&quot; Beating. The Prophet Muhammad said that the beatings should be light, and that one should avoid the face, or the sensitive areas, which might lead to broken bones, or might leave a mark that would spoil her beauty, whether on her face or anywhere on her body. Beatings that draw blood, or break bones, or leave a scar, a black mark on the skin, or any obvious mark, which would make people know that she was harshly beaten - this is forbidden.<br>
</p><p>How should the beatings go? Maybe a light slap on her shoulder, or maybe a not-so-light pinch, or a kind of gentle shove. He should make her feel that he wants to reform her, and let her know that he is displeased with her. It is like saying: None of the measures that work with sensitive people work with you. A word would be enough for any wife with lofty morals, but with you, words do not help.<br>
</p><p>Then he attempts a new direction, appealing to her femininity and emotions, by making her feel that he doesn't want her or love her. When this doesn't work, he says to her: With you, I have reached a stage which is only appropriate for inhumane people - the stage of beating.<br>

Beating is one of the punishments of religious law. What kind of people are beaten? Virgin adulterers, both men and women, are beaten as a means of discipline. Who else is beaten? A person who committed an offense and was sentenced by the judge to beatings. Who else is beaten? Someone who committed a crime. By beating his wife, the husband is saying: You've committed a grave sin that merits beatings.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Wife_Beating.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Galal Al-Khatib, Egyptian cleric</div></div>
<div class="quotes">If a person gives SR 1,200 [$320] to his wife and she spends 900 riyals [$240] to purchase an abaya [the black cover that women in Saudi Arabia must wear] from a brand shop and if her husband slaps her on the face as a reaction to her action, she deserves that punishment.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Wife_Beating.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Saudi Judge Hamad Al-Razine</div></div>
<div class="quotes">We must know that [wife] beating is a punishment in Islamic religious law,....No one should deny this because this was permitted by the Creator of Man, and because when you purchase an electric appliance or a car you get instructions – a catalogue, explaining how to use it. The Creator of Man has sent down this book [the Quran] in order to show man which ways he must choose...We shouldn't be ashamed before the nations of the world who are still in their days of ignorance, to admit that these [beatings] are part of our religious law,....We must remind the ignorant from among the Islamic Nation who followed the [West] that those [Westerners] acknowledge the wondrous nature of this verse...Allah has created woman, whether Muslim or infidel, so she is happy under a strong man who will protect her and lives with her...[The Koran says:] 'and beat them.' This verse is of a wondrous nature. There are three types of women with whom a man cannot live unless he carries a rod on his shoulder. The first type is a girl who was brought up this way. Her parents ask her to go to school and she doesn't – they beat her. 'Eat' – 'I don't want to' – they beat her. So she became accustomed to beatings; she was brought up that way. We pray Allah will help her husband later. He will only get along with her if he practices wife beating. The second type is a woman who is condescending toward her husband and ignores him. With her, too, only a rod will help. The third type is a twisted woman who will not obey her husband unless he oppresses her, beats her, uses force against her, and overpowers her with his voice.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Wife_Beating.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sermon by Muslim cleric on Qatar TV, August 27, 2004</div></div>
<div class="quotes">With regard to wife beating... In a nutshell, it appeared as part of a program to reform the wife. [According to the Koran], first 'admonish them,' [then] 'sleep in separate beds, and beat them.'...This method appeared as part of the treatment of a rebellious wife. I am faced with two options – either the family will be destroyed by divorce, or I can use means that may bring my wife, the mother of my children, back to her senses. The first means is admonishment...The second means of treatment is 'sleeping in separate beds.' Why? Because this targets the honor... A lot could be said about this. The strength of a woman lies in her ability to seduce the man. The man is strong and can do whatever he wants, but the woman has a weapon of her own. This weapon can be targeted. Many women will come back to their senses, when they realize that this is what's involved...By Allah, even if only one woman out of a million can be reformed by light beatings... It's not really beating, it's more like punching... It's like shoving or poking her. That's what it is.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Wife_Beating.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Dr. Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, President of Al-Azhar University and former Mufti of Egypt</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>Sa’d Arafat:</b> Allah honored wives by instating the punishment of beatings. 
<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Honored them with beatings? How is this possible?!
</p><p><b>Sa’d Arafat:</b> The prophet Muhammad said: “Don’t beat her in the face, and do not make her ugly.” See how she is honored. If the husband beats his wife, he must not beat her in the face. Even when he beats her, he must not curse her. This is incredible! He beats her in order to discipline her.
</p><p>In addition, there must not be more than ten beatings, and he must not break her bones, injure her, break her teeth, or poke her in the eye. There is a beating etiquette. If he beats to discipline her, he must not raise his hand high. He must beat her from chest level. All these things honor the woman. 
</p><p>She is in need of discipline. How should the husband discipline her? Through admonishment. If she is not deterred, he should refuse to share the bed with her. If she is not repentant, he should beat her, but there are rules to the beating. It is forbidden to beat her in the face or make her ugly. When you beat her, you must not curse her. Islam forbids this.
</p><p><b>Interviewer:</b> With what should be beat her? With his bare hand? With a rod?
</p><p><b>Sa’d Arafat:</b> If he beats her, the beatings should not be hard, so that they do not leave a mark. He can beat her with a short rod. He must avoid beating her in the face or in places in the head where it hurts. The beatings should be on the body and should not come one right after the other. These are all choices made during the process, but beatings are allowed only as a last resort.
</p><p>The honoring of the wife in Islam is also evident in the fact that the punishment of beating is permissible in one case only: when she refuses to sleep with him.
</p><p><b>Interviewer:</b> When she refuses to sleep with him? 
</p><p><b>Sa’d Arafat:</b> Yes, because where else could the husband go? He wants her, but she refuses. He should begin with admonishment and threats… 
</p>
<b>Interviewer:</b> Allow me to repeat this. A man cannot beat his wife...over food or drink. Beatings are permitted only in this case, which the husband cannot do without.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Wife_Beating.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Egyptian Cleric Sa’d Arafat</div></div>
<div class="quotes">A woman has the right to protest if her husband looks at her in a grim way. Allah says if a woman disobeys her husband he has the right to beat her, but the lashes should be according to the Sharia. It has conditions. (With the bill against domestic violence) the Kurdish Parliament has rejected Quranic law. (…) The parliament has also decreed that children should never be beaten for any reason. Even if the father comes home and the girl has a mobile phone in her hand that is not an excuse for beating her.
<p>Of course she is a girl and will be encouraged in this bad world of today, she will have her mobile in front of her father flirting with boys and exchanging love phrases.. The father must sit cross handed in front of her, he must either kill himself if he has the least bit of honour left – saying that if he doesn’t do that he will lose his afterlife (…)- or he must assault his daughter who already has the numbers of the police stored on her mobile, calls this organization or that and complains that her father abuses her. The man will be put in jail for 6 months, and if the girl is not satisfied she can let him stay for 3 years and rot in jail. They will fine him 5 million ID. Is this the struggle for Kurdistan we are doing here? Is this the religion we have left? The situation is very dangerous but no one will follow you to the battlefield. The people don’t have guts. If the people do have courage I will be the first to block Barzani’s path. (….)  
</p>
Three hundred members of my tribe were killed in the village of Susse. Is this what we got killed for? So that you sign these papers that deprive our families and women of honour inside our houses? If you don’t agree and say that you can’t stop the legal process, then let us confront and lead us to oppose (the parliament). We will go to the parliament and confront its president. You are the KRG, you should tell the parliament not to do this. That this is unacceptable, this is the red line. How would I allow the honour of my people to be taken away? How should I allow that girls shouldn’t be beaten at home? That a boy shouldn’t be beaten? Is it not true that the prophet – peace be upon – him says “if a child doesn’t pray when reaching 10 years, you should beat him/her.” You have thus cancelled the sayings of the prophet!<sup id="cite_ref-EKurd_7-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Wife_Beating.html#cite_note-EKurd-7">[7]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sermon by Iraqi-Kurd cleric Ismael Sosaae, protesting a 2011 Kurdish bill against domestic violence</div></div>
