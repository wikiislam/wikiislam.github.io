<p>The present-day Qur'an does not explicitly mention the act, but  according to hadith, the Qur'anic verses of stoning were written on a piece of paper and were lost when a goat ate it:
</p>
<div class="quotes">[Narrated 'Aisha] &quot;The verse of the stoning and of suckling an adult ten times were revealed, and they were (written) on a paper and kept under my bed.  When the messenger of Allah expired and we were preoccupied with his death, a goat entered and ate away the paper.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal. vol. 6. p. 269; Sunan Ibn Majah, p. 626; Ibn Qutbah, Tawil Mukhtalafi 'l-Hadith (Cairo: Maktaba al-Kulliyat al-Azhariyya. 1966) p. 310; As-Suyuti, ad-Durru 'l-Manthur, vol. 2. p. 13 </div></div>
<div class="quotes">It was narrated that 'Aishah said:
“The Verse of stoning and of breastfeeding an adult ten times was revealed, and the paper was with me under my pillow.

Then he raised his hands to the sky and said, 'O Allah! I have become old and my strength has weakened. My flock is scattered. Take me to You with nothing missed out and without having neglected anything.' Then he went to Madina and addressed the people. He said, 'People! Sunan have been laid down for you.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shaykh_Gibril_Haddad">Shaykh Gibril Haddad</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">The late Shaykh `Abd Allah al-Ghumari in Dhawq al-Halawa fi Imtina` Naskh al-Tilawa and al-Ihsan fi Ta`qib al-Itqan, denied that &quot;When the mature man and the mature woman commit adultery, stone them&quot; was ever part of the Qur'an and asserted the report to that effect was disclaimed (munkar). However, <b>it cannot be munkar since Imam Malik narrates it verbatim from our liegelord `Umar in the chapter on hadd in the Muwatta'</b>.<br>. . .<br>
<p>Yes, our liegelord `Umar radyAllahu `anhu reported that when it was revealed, the Prophet salla Allahu `alayhi wa-Sallam refrained from consigning it into writing, so it did not become mass-transmitted from him. (If it had, it would have been meaningless for `Umar to strenuously predict that innovators would one day emerge and deny that rajm was ever in the Qur'an.)
</p><p>Yet the wording is clearly related from `Umar in the Muwatta' as I mentioned in my previous post, not through al-Zuhri but through Yahya ibn Sa`id al-Ansari.
</p><p>The wording and its slight variants are also related from (1) `Umar with a weaker chain by al-Nasa'i in the Kubra, (2) Ubay ibn Ka`b by Ahmad, al-Tayalisi, Ibn Hibban etc. with sound chains, (3) `A'isha by al-Qasim ibn Sallam with a weak chain, (3) Zayd ibn Thabit in Ahmad and al-Nasa'i's Sunan al-Kubra with fair chains, (4) Sa`id ibn al-`As in Ahmad, al-Darimi, al-Nasa'i in the Sunan al-Kubra, etc. with fair chains (5) Ibn `Abbas by al-Hakim, and (6) Abu Umama ibn Hunayf's maternal aunt in al-Nasa'i's Sunan al-Kubra and al-Hakim.
</p><p>And yes, &quot;shaykh&quot; in Arabic does not connote betrothal but only age. `Iyad in his commentary on Sahih Muslim said its wording was plainly not Qur'anic; and al-Tabari narrates with his chain that that very wording was read out to the Prophet from the Torah. Evidently, the Torah wording was written, famous and widespread while Allah Most High lifted up the Qur'anic wording and caused it to be forgotten.
</p>
However, <b>the ruling was identical and remained: it is transmitted from al-Zuhri by eight of his students that `Umar said: &quot;Rajm is firmly established in the Book of Allah.&quot;</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://mac.abc.se/home/onesr/ez/in/it1/Abrogation_Hadith.txt">Abrogation and Hadith</a><br>Shaykh Gibril Fouad Haddad, Living Islam, December 23, 2008</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recent_Fatwas">Recent Fatwas</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">....the prescribed punishment for adultery, which means an illegitimate sexual intercourse between a married man and a woman married to another man is stoning to death. But this offense must be proven either through a confession made voluntarily by the accused or by the testimony of four witnesses who state under oath that they have witnessed the commission of the crime. It's only after this legal procedure that the accused will be punished by lapidation. This punishment is agreed upon by scholars and there is no question about it.<br>. . .<br>
<p>In the Kuwaiti Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence, we read the following: 
</p><p>Ibn Qudamah wrote: “Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact stoning to death is a specified punishment for married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of Kharijites.”
</p><p><br>
Al-Bahuty said: “The authentic practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) supports stoning to death as a punishment specified for adultery. In addition, the verse commanding this punishment was revealed in the Qur’an. Later, it was verbally abrogated but its ruling is still binding.<br>. . .<br>
Stoning to death is a Divine obligation and punishment <b>specified for any married adulterer or adulteress once there is four witnesses or the confession of the accused.</b>”<br>. . .<br>
</p>
Finally, we would like to note that there are many incidents in the Sunnah and the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) in which the Prophet stoned the married adulterer and adulteress to death. This happened in the case of Ma`iz and the Ghamidi woman. <b>All this makes it clear that the punishment is proven and authentic and is not debatable</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545902?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545902">Stoning: Does It Have Any Basis in Shari`ah?</a><br>Fatwa from Islam Online, March 29, 2005</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allaah.   
<p><b>It is essential to stone the married adulterer until he dies, following the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as it is proven that he said that, did it and enjoined it.</b> The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoned Maa’iz, the Juhani woman, the Ghaamidi woman, and the two Jews. All of that is proven in saheeh ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The scholars among the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), the Taabi’een and those who came after them are also unanimously agreed on that. No one differed from them apart from those to whose views no attention is to be paid. Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated in their Saheehs from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the truth and revealed to him the Book, and one of the things that Allaah revealed was the verse of stoning. We have read it and understood it. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoned (adulterers) and we stoned (them) after him, but I fear that there may come a time when some people say: ‘By Allaah, we do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allaah.’ So they will go astray by forsaking an obligation that Allaah has revealed. According to the Book of Allaah, stoning is deserved by the one who commits zina, if he is married, men and women alike, if proof is established or the woman becomes pregnant or they confess…” 
</p><p>Based on this, it is not permissible to replace stoning with killing by the sword or shooting, because stoning is a more severe punishment and a more effective deterrent to the sin of zina, which is the most grave sin after shirk and killing a soul whom Allaah has forbidden us to kill. <b>The hadd punishment of stoning for a married person who commits zina is one of the matters that is determined by the Qur’aan and Sunnah and there is no room for ijtihaad or personal opinion.</b> If killing by the sword or shooting were permissible in the case of the married adulterer then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have done that and would have explained it to his ummah, and his companions after him would have done that too.
