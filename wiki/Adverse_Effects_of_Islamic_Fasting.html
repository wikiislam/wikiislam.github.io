<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Medical fasting can have <a href="wiki/Health.html" title="Health">health</a> benefits. However, Medical fasting differs from Islamic fasting, and contrary to popular Muslim beliefs, Islamic fasting, unlike Medical fasting, has numerous adverse effects. As we will explain here, Islamic fasting has significant harmful effects on health, national economy and productivity, crime rate, public safety and social behavior. Health effects include heat stress, dehydration, migraines and, for lactating women, the nutritional make-up of their milk, amongst others. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_Islamic_Fasting.3F">What is Islamic Fasting?</span></h3>
<p>The salient features of Islamic fasting are:
</p>
<ul><li> For 30 days every <a href="wiki/Islamic_Lunar_Calendar.html" title="Islamic Lunar Calendar">lunar year</a> (during the month of Ramadan), waking up before dawn and eating and <a href="wiki/Drinks.html" title="Drinks">drinking</a> to prepare for the fast (binge eating is a common habit).<sup id="cite_ref-Anjali_Dange_1-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-Anjali_Dange-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li> Refraining from consuming any food or water from dawn to sunset</li>
<li> Breaking the fast at sunset and again eating and drinking to prepare for the day ahead. </li></ul>
<p>Some Muslims claim eating a small amount of <a href="wiki/Food.html" title="Food">food</a> is the correct Islamic way however we cannot function for the whole day by eating only a small amount of food at the time of dawn. This would affect our performance even more during the day.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Effects_on_Health">Effects on Health</span></h2>
<p>In a recent study done on the Arab world, diseases linked to cholesterol and diabetes increased by 27.65% because of overeating.<sup id="cite_ref-ANSA_3-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-ANSA-3">[3]</a></sup> Non-compliance with prescribed treatment regimens is common during Ramadan. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Other health effects include:
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dehydration">Dehydration</span></h3>
<p>One study finds that incidences of dehydration increase during the month of Ramadan:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> <b>PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS</b> 
<p>Evidence of hemoconcentration and dehydration has been found during Ramadan (El-Hazmi, Al-Faleh, &amp; Al-Mofleh, 1987; Kayikcioglu et al., 1999; Ramadan et al., 1999; Schmahl &amp; Metzler, 1991; Sweileh et al., 1992). Restricted fluid intake, leading to disturbance in the fluid balance, is likely to cause these conditions. In the initial stages of dehydration, the clinical signs are tachycardia, tiredness and malaise, headaches and nausea. Middle-aged or more elderly persons are usually more prone to the effects of dehydration (Schmahl &amp; Metzler). 
</p>
Dehydration is indicated by the increase of several serum biochemical parameters (El-Hazmi et al., 1987; Ramadan et al., 1999; Schmahl &amp; Metzler, 1991; Sweileh et al., 1992). The increase in uric acid, however, should especially be noted (El-Ati et al, 1995; El-Hazmi et al., 1987; Fedail et al., 1982; Schmahl &amp; Metzler, 1991), because hyperuricemia is one of the known sequelae of prolonged fasting (Murphy &amp; Shipman, 1963). Hyperuricemia is associated with reduction in glomerular filtration rate, decrease in uric acid clearance and alterations in the renal transport of uric acid (Murphy &amp; Shipman). During Ramadan, however, reports show that the increase in uric acid does not excessively deviate from the normal range and studies have not reported clinical gout (El-Hazmi et al., 1987; Fedail et al., 1982). Increased uric acid is, therefore, unlikely to affect healthy individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-Morimoto_5-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-Morimoto-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Migraines">Migraines</span></h3>
<p>Migraines are three times more common during Ramadan, affecting an estimated 90 million Muslims:
</p>
<div class="quotes">An estimated 90 million of the world’s 1.57 billion Muslims are likely to suffer from migraine headaches during the dawn-to-dusk fasts during the month of Ramadan – which begins on Wednesday, at the height of summer heat. But Jewish researchers in the US and Israel have suggested how to help prevent the problem.
<p>Dr. Ibrahim Abu-Salameh, Israel’s only Beduin neurologist – who works at Soroka University Medical Center in Beersheba – headed a team that found migraine attacks are three times more common during the Muslim fast than in the rest of the year.
</p><p>Working with colleagues Dr. Igal Plecht and Dr. Gal Ifergan of the Beersheba hospital, Abu-Salameh studied 32 Beduin who suffered from migraine attacks during the Ramadan fast last year and compared the statistics to an ordinary month without the fast as a control.
</p><p>Migraines were much more common in women than men; three-quarters of the women complained of migraine while fasting, compared to a much lower figure among the men. The Soroka study was published recently in the Journal of Headache and Pain.<br>. . .<br>
</p><p>Abu-Salameh said that he has gotten migraine headaches during Ramadan, and has treated Beduin who came to his clinic complaining about severe headaches. He noted that the medical literature has almost ignored the phenomenon until now.
</p>
Meanwhile, Dr. Michael J. Drescher of Hartford Hospital in Connecticut and colleagues at Sheba and Shaare Zedek Medical Centers in Israel recently suggested that otherwise-healthy Muslims suffering from migraine attacks during the Ramadan fast ask their doctors for a prescription for etoricoxib (commercial name Arcoxia) to prevent the headaches that come with fasting.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tachycardia.2C_Severe_Headaches.2C_Dizziness.2C_Nausea.2C_Vomiting_and_Circulatory_Collapse">Tachycardia, Severe Headaches, Dizziness, Nausea, Vomiting and Circulatory Collapse</span></h3>
<p>The following study was carried out on  <a href="wiki/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> Muslims in <a href="wiki/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> who were involved in heavy and manual work. 'Moderate to severe health disturbances' including severe dehydration were found in such laborers during Ramadan:
</p>
<div class="quotes">
<p><b>Abstract</b> 
</p>
During Ramadan, Moslems are required strictly to avoid fluids and nourishment from dawn to sunset. Heat stress during such abstinence represents a substantial health hazard. In the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) where numerous Moslems, particularly of Turkish origin, perform heat work and other heavy labour, we observed moderate to severe health disturbances in such labourers during Ramadan, e.g.: <b>tachycardia, severe headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and circulatory collapse</b>. The <b>severe dehydration</b> of these workers was demonstrated by substantial increases in their hematocrit, serum protein, urea, creatinine, uric acid and electrolyte imbalance. Because of the evidence of the substantial health hazard to Islamic workers in such situations, we have strongly urged employers to refrain from assigning Islamic workers to heat work or heavy daytime work during Ramadan; we have therefore limited systematic studies of health problems during Ramadan to persons performing only moderate work. Even under these conditions signs of dehydration were found in the 32 labourers monitored. Some of these labourers also had to interrupt their observance of Ramadan due to health problems, e.g.: acute gout due to serum uric acid increase, or circulatory insufficiency. In light of the observed potentially harmful pathophysiological effects, the danger of dehydration of Islamic workers due to heat work during Ramadan should be taken very seriously.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>Naturally we would expect that this would affect productivity, as is evidenced in a later section on Economical effects.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weight_Fluctuation">Weight Fluctuation</span></h3>
<p>The following study takes a look at the significant fluctuations in the weight of individuals that occurs during the month of Ramadan, primarily as a result of the metabolic changes that occur in the body.  
</p>
<div class="quotes">Numerous studies have reported significant weight loss during Ramadan (Adlouni, Ghalim, Benslimane, Lecerf, &amp; Saile, 1997; Adlouni et al., 1998; Fedail, Murphy, Salih, Bolton, &amp; Harvey, 1982; Kayikcioglu, Erkin, &amp; Erakgun, 1999; Ramadan, Telahoun, Al-Zaid, &amp; Barac-Nieto, 1999; Schmahl &amp; Metzler, 1991; Sweileh, Schnitzler, Hunter, &amp; Davis, 1992). The declines may result from water loss early in Ramadan and loss of body fat during the later period (Sweileh et al., 1992). In fact, we did find evidence of dehydration. 
<p>Loss of body fat would indicate the use of fat for energy production during Ramadan (Husain, Duncan, Cheah, &amp; Ch'ng, 1987; Ramadan et al., 1999; Sweileh et al., 1992). In addition, researchers have found decreased heart rate and oxygen consumption during Ramadan (Husain et al., 1987; Ramadan et al., 1999; Sweileh et al., 1992). These findings suggest a metabolic adaptation to fasting. It seems that during the Ramadan daylight hours - when no food or water is taken in - to conserve stored energy, the metabolism slows down (Sweileh et al., 1992). 
</p>
Other studies, however, have reported no change in body weight during Ramadan (El-Ati, Beji, &amp; Danguir, 1995; Finch, Day, Razak, Welch, &amp; Rogers 1998; Maislos et al., 1993; Maislos, Abou-Rabiah, Zuili, Iordash, &amp; Shany, 1998). In fact, one study carried out in Saudi Arabia reported a significant increase in body weight during Ramadan (Frost &amp; Pirani, 1987). Such variations may be attributable to local custom and food quality. In short, in Islamic communities - as elsewhere - food habits vary according to geography, culture, and socioeconomic factors (Musaiger, 1993; Rashed, 1992). Ramadan is a special month and the variety of foods generally increases (Karaagaoglu &amp; Yucecan, 2000) so, during this period, richer meals and special treats are not uncommon in households that can afford them.<sup id="cite_ref-Morimoto_5-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-Morimoto-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Affect_on_Circadian_Patterns_and_Sleep_Disorders">Affect on Circadian Patterns and Sleep Disorders</span></h3>
<p>The results of the following study can lead us to conclude that fasting negatively effects an individual's circadian rhythm. As a result, unfavorable side-effects such as lethargy and a lack of motivation, may contribute to a society's lack of productivity:
</p>
<div class="quotes">This change of meal schedule is accompanied with changes in sleep habits, such as delayed and shortened sleep periods, which may affect endocrine and neuroendocrine circadian patterns. Several cardiovascular parameters (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, vascular tone, and coagulation-fibrinolysis) show circadian pattern. Several studies reported that autonomic activity and melatonin rhtyhmicity may be responsible for circadian patterns of cardiovascular parameters. <b>Changes of sleep habit in Ramadan affects autonomic activity and melatonin rhtyhmicity</b>. The other negative effects may be that, during fasting patients with cardiovascular disease cannot consume medications, such as anti-ischemic, anti-platelet, anti-hypertensive drugs, and drugs of heart failure on time. Some patients may get admitted to the hospital with cardiovascular symptoms owing to failure of therapy.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>The following study was done in Saudi Arabia and it was observed that melatonin levels and REM sleep decreased during Ramadan:
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Abstract:</b> 
Fasting during Ramadan is distinct from regular voluntary or experimental fasting. This project was conducted to objectively assess the effect of Ramadan fasting on sleep architecture, daytime sleepiness and the circadian cycle of melatonin level. Eight healthy volunteers reported to the Sleep Disorders Center on four occasions for polysomnography and multiple sleep latency tests: 1) an initial visit for adaptation; 2) 2 weeks before Ramadan (BL); and 3,4) during the first and third weeks of Ramadan (R1, R3). Salivary melatonin level was measured using radioimmunoassay. Sleep latency at night was significantly shorter and the amount of rapid eye movement sleep was significantly less, at R3 compared to BL. There was no difference in multiple sleep latency test data between BL and Ramadan. Although melatonin level kept the same circadian pattern at BL, R1 and R3, <b>it had a flatter slope and a significantly lower peak at midnight (00:00) at R1 and R3.</b> <b>This study showed a significant reduction in sleep latency and rapid eye movement sleep during the third week of Ramadan fasting.</b> Otherwise, there was no significant effect of Ramadan on sleep architecture and assessment revealed no increase in daytime sleepiness. Although melatonin level had the same circadian pattern during Ramadan, the <b>level of the hormone dropped significantly from baseline.</b><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Daytime_Drowsiness.2C_Alertness_and_Cognition">Daytime Drowsiness, Alertness and Cognition</span></h3>
<p>Naturally, a fast would indicate that individuals are ingesting less food. But the following two studies reveal that the decrease in the number of meals that are eaten directly disturbs normal sleep habits and thereby increases daytime drowsiness.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
<p><b>Abstract</b> 
</p>
Few epidemiological data have been reported on the relation between Ramadan fasting, life habits (meal frequency, sleep habits) and daytime sleepiness during Ramadan. This paper presents the results of a detailed study of the chronotype and daytime sleepiness before and during Ramadan. It was conducted on a sample of 264 subjects aged between 20 and 30 years. Results have revealed a significant decrease in the meal frequency during Ramadan compared with the control period. Before Ramadan, the majority of subjects woke up between 6 and 7 a.m. and went to sleep between 10 and 11 p.m. however, during Ramadan fasting, they woke up after 8 a.m. and preferred to go to sleep later (after midnight). Chronotype as evaluated by the Horne and Ostberg scale was changed significantly during Ramadan: an increase of the evening type and a decrease in the morning type of subjects was observed. Daytime sleepiness as evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was significantly increased.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>The following study studies the effect that fasting has on the alertness of an individual. Evidently, the change in sleep patterns causes a decrease in oral temperature and alertness:

<div class="quotes">
<p><b>Abstract</b> 
</p>
During the month of Ramadan, Moslems abstain from drinking and eating daily between sunrise and sunset. This change of meals schedule is accompanied with changes in sleep habit, which may affect diurnal alertness. This study examined the effect of Ramadan intermittent fasting on the diurnal alertness and oral temperature in 10 healthy young subjects. The cognitive task battery including movement reaction time (MRT), critical flicker fusion (CFF) and visual analogue scale, was administered at 6 different times of the day: 09.00, 11.00, 13.00, 16.00, 20.00 and 23.00 h on the 6th, 15th, and 28th days of Ramadan. The baseline day was scheduled one week before Ramadan, and the recovery day 18 days after this month. Oral temperature was measured prior to each test session and at 00.00 h. During Ramadan oral temperature decreased at 09.00, 11.00, 13.00, 16.00 and 20.00 h and increased at 23.00 and 00.00 h. Subjective alertness decreased at 09.00 and 16.00 h and increased at 23.00 h. Mood decreased at 16.00 h. MRT was increased at the beginning of Ramadan (R6) and CFF was not changed. These results showed that daytime oral temperature, subjective alertness and mood were decreased during Ramadan intermittent fasting.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cognition">Cognition</span></h3>
<p>The physical fatigue associated with fasting results in impairment of cognitive function, as shown by performance in flicker fusion tests. <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

<div class="quotes">A new study by scientists in the United States has revealed that pregnant Muslim women who fast during Ramadan are likely to have smaller babies who will be more prone to learning disabilities in adulthood. 
<p>The researchers also found that the women were 10 per cent less likely to give birth to a boy if they had fasted during Ramadan. The trend was clearest if the fasting was done early in the women’s pregnancy, and during the summer months, when long hours of daylight called for them to go longer without food.<br>. . .<br>
</p><p>The study, which used census data from the US, Iraq and Uganda, also discovered long-term effects on the adult’s health and his or her future economic success.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Increases_the_toxicity_of_commonly_used_medication">Increases the toxicity of commonly used medication</span></h3>
<p>Fasting has been found to significantly change drug metabolism and deplete crucial chemicals in the liver needed to detoxify medication.
</p><p>Paracetemol (also called acetaminophen) is one of the most commonly used drugs to treat day to day pain such as headaches or gastrointestinal pain, this is the very same pain that is likely to be encountered by a fasting individual. Therefore, a significant risk arises when someone who has been fasting takes this common medication (among many others).
</p><p>As the Journal of Internal Medicine Reports:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Paracetamol-related hepatotoxicity is now the most common cause of the potentially devastating clinical syndrome of acute liver failure in many western countries. In patients who develop liver damage following moderate paracetamol overdose in the order of 5–10 g daily, recent fasting and nutritional impairment have been identified as key precipitants.
In keeping with experience in the modest paracetamol overdose setting [6], it is likely that fasting occurring on a background of longstanding diminished caloric intake and severe malnutrition played an important role in the development of paracetamol-induced liver damage at recommended dosage of 4 g daily in this patient. Fasting and malnutrition result in reduction of hepatic levels of glutathione, required for inactivation of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine, the toxic metabolite of paracetamol [6]. A 16-h period of fasting is sufficient to substantially deplete hepatic glutathione stores in mice [11]. <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p><b>Abstract</b>  
</p><p>OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that people in Morocco are more irritable during the month of Ramadan than during the rest of the year. Our objectives were to measure irritability in fasting Muslims during the month of Ramadan, to describe its various modes of expression, and to examine risk factors for this irritability. 
</p><p>METHODS AND SUBJECTS: We studied 100 healthy volunteers during the month of Ramadan for two successive years (1994 and 1995). All subjects were male (mean age, 32+/-5.8 years), and 51% of them were smokers. Irritability was assessed over a 6-week period (before, four times during, and after the end of Ramadan). We assessed both subjective (visual analog scale) and objective irritability. We also recorded the consumption of psychostimulants, duration of sleep, and anxiety level as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. 
</p>
RESULTS: Irritability was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers before the beginning of Ramadan. It was higher in both groups during the Ramadan month. <b>Irritability increased continuously during Ramadan and reached its peak at the end of the month.</b> Consumption of psychostimulants (coffee and tea) and anxiety level followed the same pattern. Smokers and nonsmokers had a similar pattern of irritability over time, but irritability increased more in smokers than in nonsmokers.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><br> </div>

One hundred and eighty-seven subjects had some type of health problems, among whom 60.4% were using drugs, and 31.6% were on diets; however, during Ramadan 9.7 and 18.8% of the subjects dropped taking drugs and did not regularly keep on diets, respectively. During the fasting time, from dawn to sunset, 34.3% of the subjects developed some behavioural disturbances, such as feeling tired and being unwilling to work. Although the meal consumed at dawn consisted of foods that were usually eaten at breakfast, the meal consumed at sunset consisted of a great variety of foods. Calcium intake was the most insufficiently consumed nutrient. It was observed that the daily energy intakes were less than the expenditures both in males and females.

<p>During Ramadan last year in Egypt, a church was burned to the ground. At least 155 Egyptian Christians were arrested for not participating in Ramadan. Last September, Rody Rodeheaver with I.N. Network  explained that Ramadan &quot;is a time when Muslims who are moderate often become much more aggressive about their faith, and they [see it] as a time to be aggressive as they deal with Christians.&quot; Rodeheaver also noted that many people are somewhat psychologically distraught by a lack of food since Muslims are required to fast during Ramadan.

<p>Intermittent and prolonged fasting is generally not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. Depriving the body of water and essential nutrients by dividing and postponing meals to irregular intervals does nothing to limit consumption. In-fact it causes a host of health, performance and mood disorders. Fasting is not normally prescribed for the well being of human beings. Instead, it is commonly understood that eating healthy, smaller-portioned meals, interspersed throughout the day is far better in maintaining a well-balanced diet and far more forgiving on a person's metabolism.  Any claims that prolonged and intermittent fasting contributes to the well-being of an individual's health are misleading, based on the scientific studies that prove otherwise. If the Islamic argument in favor of fasting is that “we fast because Allah commanded us to do so,&quot; then it is obvious that <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> is not a nutritionist or a dietitian because the negatives definitely outweigh the positives.
</p><p>So the question to the Muslim world is: keeping in mind the above adverse affects of fasting observed in studies, what benefit does the Muslim world get for 1 billion people staying hungry throughout the day for one full month every year? Did Allah actually want Muslims to suffer physically, socially and economically for one month every year? Also, if fasting is beneficial as Muslims claim, why do Muslims not fast the entire year instead of just one month?

<ol><li><i><b>&quot;Most of the evidence provided is from newspaper articles. Not very scientific is it?&quot;</b></i><br>The claim that &quot;most of the evidence provided is from news paper articles&quot; is false. The majority of this page references and quotes directly from the conclusions of scientific studies.  It also quotes medical experts and statistics provided by Medical facilities. As for the news articles quoted here, they are reliable sources that reference and describe the conclusions of scientific studies. For an indepth section by section response, see the '<a href="wiki/Talk-Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html" title="Talk:Adverse Effects of Islamic Fasting">talk</a>' page, or simply view the references provided below.</li>
<li><i><b>&quot;Muslims do not fast in Ramadan so they can be healthy. They fast because Allah commanded them to.&quot;</b></i><br>This is true. But many Muslims attempt to justify this unhealthy practice by claiming it is healthy. Besides, if Allah is all-knowing and merciful, he would not endanger his followers' health by making a hazardous activity become compulsory. However, it would make complete sense if we were to accept he is ignorant of <a href="wiki/Islam_and_Science.html" title="Islam and Science">science</a> or a <a href="wiki/Jahannam.html#Why_It_Makes_Allah_a_Sadist" title="Jahannam">sadist</a>. But then why would anyone want to worship such a deity?</li>
<li><i><b>&quot;Islam is just one of numerous religions (Hinduism, Christianity, Catholicism etc.) that prescribe fasting for its people.&quot;</b></i><br>This claim is true, but also very disingenuous. Rules vary but fasting in Christianity is not compulsory, nor is it expected to be a complete fast. Meaning Christians generally reduce (not stop) their intake of food, and also drink freely during fasts. This is perfectly healthy and not comparable to the Islamic sawm. Similarly in Hinduism, fasting is a part of the religion, but individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on their personal beliefs and local customs.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> This argument is also a logical fallacy known as <a href="wiki/Tu_Quoque.html" title="Tu Quoque">ad hominem tu quoque</a>. Meaning it is not a valid defense of Islam, but a diversion that some may construe as an indirect admission of Islam's flaws.</li></ol>
