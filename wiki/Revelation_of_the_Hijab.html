<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>If you ask a Muslim why Muslim females wear the Hijab (veil) the reason given is usually one of two (or a mixture of both):
</p>
<ul><li> They are obeying a command from <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> as given in the <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>; it is a matter of piety.</li>
<li> They are protecting their modesty by dressing this way instead of showing their body off for everyone to see. </li></ul>
<p>The crux of the issue is how this mandate made its way into the Qur'an in the first place? We can find this information in the ahadith by examining the <a href="wiki/Revelational_Circumstances_of_the_Quran.html" title="Revelational Circumstances of the Quran">revelational circumstances</a> of these verses.
</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Surah_24:31">Surah 24:31</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>Yusuf Ali:</b>And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; <b>that they should draw their veils over their bosoms</b> and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss. 
<p><b>Pickthal:</b> And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, <b>and to draw their veils over their bosoms</b>, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers or their brothers' sons or sisters' sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male attendants who lack vigour, or children who know naught of women's nakedness. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And turn unto Allah together, O believers, in order that ye may succeed. 
</p>
<b>Shakir:</b> And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof, <b>and let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms</b>, and not display their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands possess, or the male servants not having need (of women), or the children who have not attained knowledge of what is hidden of women; and let them not strike their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments may be known; and turn to Allah all of you, O believers! so that you may be successful.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php#024.031#024.031">24:31</a></div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Surah_33:59">Surah 33:59</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 
<p><b>Pickthal:</b> O Prophet! Tell thy wives and thy daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad). That will be better, so that they may be recognized and not annoyed. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 
</p>
<b>Shakir:</b> O Prophet! say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments; this will be more proper, that they may be known, and thus they will not be given trouble; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/033-qmt.php#033.059#033.059">33:59</a></div></div>
<p><br>
The first verse above states that the purpose is to hide women's <a href="wiki/Beauty.html" title="Beauty">beauty</a> from men. The second verse makes it clear that it is to prevent molestation/harassment whilst traveling. We also do not find any such requirement for Muslim men. What are the possible explanations for this?
</p>
<ul><li> Women's beauty is so enticing that men are unable to control themselves if they see an uncovered female - This cannot be right because women do not have to cover themselves in front of those males to whom they are related.</li>
<li> Women are not attracted to men - Even the casual observer knows this is untrue - the vast majority of women are not asexual. </li>
<li> Women have more self control than men - This may very well be the case, but only with the caveat that 'men' refers to Muslim men. </li></ul>
<p>The current perception in Islamic society is that an unveiled woman is asking to be sexually harassed or assaulted. Although not a guarantee, they  believe that the wearing of a veil is added protection against the chance of assault. However as we look at the ahadith, we find that <i>none</i> of the above reasons are correct as we see when studying the revelational circumstances of these verses. The Hijab verses were sent down in response to a specific situation occurring at the time.

<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Aisha: 
The wives of the Prophet used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqia at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. 'Umar used to say to the Prophet &quot;Let your wives be veiled,&quot; but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam'a the wife of the Prophet went out at 'Isha' time and she was a tall lady. 'Umar addressed her and said, &quot;I have recognized you, O Sauda.&quot; He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed.

The wives of the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.' Once Sauda, the daughter of Zam'a went out and she was a tall woman. 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her while he was in a gathering, and said, &quot;I have recognized you, O Sauda!&quot; He ('Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover excluding the eyes).

<div class="quotes">'A'isha reported that the wives of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) used to go out in the cover of night when they went to open fields (in the outskirts of Medina) for easing themselves. 'Umar b Khattab used to say: Allah's Messenger, ask your ladies to observe veil, but Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not do that. So there went out Sauda, daughter of Zarn'a, the wife of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him), during one of the nights when it was dark. She was a tall statured lady. 'Umar called her saying: Sauda, we recognise you. (He did this with the hope that the verses pertaining to veil would be revealed.) 'A'isha said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, then revealed the verses pertaining to veil. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/026-smt.php#026.5397#026.5397">26:5397</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes"> This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab with the same chain of transmitters.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/026-smt.php#026.5398#026.5398">26:5398</a></div></div>
<p>In short, the sequence of events as laid out in the ahadith are as follows:
</p>
<ol><li>Umar repeatedly asks <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> that Allah should reveal verses for the Qur'an pertaining to the veiling of women.</li>
<li>No such <a href="wiki/Revelations.html" title="Revelations">revelation</a> is sent down.</li>
<li>Umar follows <a href="wiki/Muhammad's_Wives.html" title="Muhammad's Wives">Muhammad's wives</a> one night when they go out to relieve themselves (go to the toilet) and calls out to Muhammad's wife Sauda.</li>
<li>Sauda goes home in a state of embarrassment and relates to Muhammad what has happened.</li>
<li>Allah then reveals the hijab verse as Umar had wanted all along. </li></ol>
<p>Of course this brings up some obvious questions:
</p>
<ul><li> If Muhammad is just a messenger, relating Allah's word, why did Umar ask Muhammad for the hijab revelation?  Why did he not just pray to Allah and ask directly?</li>
<li> No revelation was sent down until Umar spied on Muhammad's own wives. Why did Umar do this? How did he know (or at least suspect) it would be successful? Why does Allah care about toilet privacy so much that he revealed a verse pertaining to <i>all</i> Muslim women that will ever live?</li></ul>
<p>A common apologetic for this is that Allah was waiting for Umar to do this so that the situational revelation could come down. However this is not mentioned anywhere, thus there is no evidence for it. Moreover, Umar confirms that he came up with the idea first and then Allah &quot;agreed with him&quot;.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Allah_Agrees_with_Umar">Allah Agrees with Umar</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas: 
<p>Umar said, &quot;I agreed with Allah in three things,&quot; or said, &quot;My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.' I also said, 'O Allah's Apostle! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, 'You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.' When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O 'Umar! Does Allah's Apostle haven't what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?' &quot; Thereupon Allah revealed:-- 
</p>
&quot;It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah)..&quot; (66.5) <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/060-sbt.php#006.060.010#006.060.010">6:60:10</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes"> Narrated Umar:
I said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! Good and bad persons enter upon you, so I suggest that you order the mothers of the Believers (i.e. your wives) to observe veils.&quot; Then Allah revealed the Verses of Al-Hijab. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/060-sbt.php#006.060.313#006.060.313">6:60:313</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes"> Ibn Umar reported Umar as saying: My lord concorded with (my judgments) on three occasions. In case of the Station of Ibrahim, in case of the observance of veil and in case of the prisoners of Badr.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/031-smt.php#031.5903#031.5903">31:5903</a></div></div>
<p>How can the Qur'an be the text that was in existence since before the world began, if Allah is taking suggestions for its content from Muhammad's contemporaries? 
It appears however, that Umar was a serial toilet-place loiterer, because after the revelation of the verses he had so wanted, he was at it again.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Umar_Spies_Again">Umar Spies Again</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Aisha: 
Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil. She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &quot;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah's Apostle was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! I went out to answer the call of nature and 'Umar said to me so-and-so.&quot; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &quot;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/060-sbt.php#006.060.318#006.060.318">6:60:318</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes"> A'isha reported that Sauda (Allah be pleased with her) went out (in the fields) in order to answer the call of nature even after the time when veil had been prescribed for women. She had been a bulky lady, significant in height amongst the women, and she could not conceal herself from him who had known her. 'Umar b. Khattab saw her and said: Sauda, by Allah, you cannot conceal from us. Therefore, be careful when you go out. She ('A'isha) said: She turned back. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) was at that time in my house having his evening meal and there was a bone in his hand. She (Sauda) cline and said: Allah's Messenger. I went out and 'Umar said to me so and so. She ('A'isha) reported: There came the revelation to him and then it was over; the bone was then in his hand and he had not thrown it and he said:&quot; Permission has been granted to you that you may go out for your needs.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/026-smt.php#026.5395#026.5395">26:5395</a></div></div>
<p>Apparently, Umar was not satisfied once he had gotten the Hijab verses he eagerly bothered Muhammad about. He wanted women to be completely unrecognizable.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reasoning_on_the_Hijab">Reasoning on the Hijab</span></h3>
<p>A common claim by <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> is that the Hijab protects women against unwanted sexual attention from men. Well known apologist <a href="wiki/Dr..html" title="Dr." class="mw-redirect">Dr.</a> <a href="wiki/Zakir_Naik.html" title="Zakir Naik">Zakir Naik</a> takes this line of reasoning in his <a href="wiki/Zakir_Naik-_His_Background,_Views_and_Debates.html#Hijab" title="Zakir Naik: His Background, Views and Debates">defense of the hijab</a> mandate. Before evaluating this claim we must examine a few more ahadith:
</p>
<div class="quotes">'A'isha reported that a eunuch used to come to the wives of Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and they did not And anything objectionable in his visit considering him to be a male without any sexual desire. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) one day came as he was sitting with some of his wives and he was busy in describing the bodily characteristics of a lady and saying: As the comes in front four folds appear on her front side and as she turns her back eight folds appear on the back side. Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: I me that he knows these things; do not, therefore. allow him to cater. She (&quot; A'isha) said: Then they began to observe veil from him.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/026-smt.php#026.5416#026.5416">26:5416</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
A mukhannath (eunuch) used to enter upon the wives of Prophet (peace be upon him). They (the people) counted him among those who were free of physical needs. One day the Prophet (peace be upon him) entered upon us when he was with one of his wives, and was describing the qualities of a woman, saying: When she comes forward, she comes forward with four (folds in her stomach), and when she goes backward, she goes backward with eight (folds in her stomach). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Do I not see that this (man) knows what here lies. Then they (the wives) observed veil from him. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/032-sat.php#032.4095#032.4095">32:4095</a> </div></div>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Evaluating_the_.22Protection.22_Claim">Evaluating the &quot;Protection&quot; Claim</span></h4>
<p>Given the fact that the verses were first revealed after Umar verbally harassed Muhammad's wives while they were going to the toilet, and that Muhammad told women to wear the veil even in the presence of a eunuch, we must conclude that the veil is only intended to prevent men from evaluating the physical attributes of females. Since eunuchs have no sexual desire, the claim that it is to prevent sexual molestation and not just gossip/verbal harassment is scripturally invalid.  
</p><p>Another interesting thing to note is that all of the verses and ahadith examined so far are to do with <i>Muslim men</i> harassing <i>Muslim females</i>.  Thus Allah has revealed this verse to protect the believing women from the believing men. 
</p><p>In non-Islamic societies, women are generally free to walk around unveiled and not be harassed/assaulted every few blocks by men, but in an Islamic society (e.g. in <a href="wiki/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> where women and young girls are harassed 7 times every 200 meters<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Revelation_of_the_Hijab.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Revelation_of_the_Hijab.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> or in <a href="wiki/Saudi_Arabia.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> where the observance of hijab is strictly enforced but the country still has one of the highest <a href="wiki/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> scales in the world<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Revelation_of_the_Hijab.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>) this would not be the case. If not arrested under indecency laws, women would be constantly harassed and/or assaulted by Muslim men.
</p><p>Furthermore, certain studies carried out in the Muslim world have proven that the widely-held belief that a veil is added protection against the chance of assault is actually false (i.e.  the majority of victims wear the hijab).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Revelation_of_the_Hijab.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Thus we can conclude that the hypothetical situations like that presented by Naik and other apologist, in favor of the Hijab, are not only scripturally invalid, but also technically invalid, even in Islamic societies.

<p>There are other ahadith that talk of the 'verses of al-hijab' but these are concerning a <a href="wiki/Sex_Segregation_in_Islam.html" title="Sex Segregation in Islam">different type of hijab</a> (veil) with, of course, a different set of revelational circumstances.

<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas bin Malik: 
<p>When Allah's Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh, he invited the people to a meal. They took the meal and remained sitting and talking. Then the Prophet (showed them) as if he is ready to get up, yet they did not get up. When he noticed that (there was no response to his movement), he got up, and the others too, got up except three persons who kept on sitting. The Prophet came back in order to enter his house, but he went away again. Then they left, whereupon I set out and went to the Prophet to tell him that they had departed, so he came and entered his house. <b>I wanted to enter along with him, but he put a screen between me and him.

So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite. Then I said, &quot;O Allah's Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite.&quot; He said, &quot;Carry away the remaining food.&quot; Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting.

Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him.

<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas bin Malik: 
I was ten years old when Allah's Apostle arrived at Medina. My mother and aunts used to urge me to serve the Prophet regularly, and I served him for ten years. When the Prophet died I was twenty years old, and I knew about the order of Al-Hijab (veiling of ladies) more than any other person when it was revealed. It was revealed for the first time when Allah's Apostle had consummated his marriage with Zainab bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the threshold of 'Aisha's dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then, he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with him. When we reached the threshold of 'Aisha's dwelling place, he thought that they had left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people had left. <b>Then the Prophet drew a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were revealed.</b> <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/062-sbt.php#007.062.095#007.062.095">7:62:95</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas bin Malik: 
that he was a boy of ten at the time when the Prophet emigrated to Medina. He added: I served Allah's Apostle for ten years (the last part of his life time) and I know more than the people about the occasion whereupon the order of Al-Hijab was revealed (to the Prophet). Ubai b n Ka'b used to ask me about it. It was revealed (for the first time) during the marriage of Allah's Apostle with Zainab bint Jahsh. In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah's Apostle and they prolonged their stay. Allah's Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with him till he came to the lintel of 'Aisha's dwelling place. Allah's Apostle thought that those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of 'Aisha's dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone.<b> At that time the Divine Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed, and the Prophet set a screen between me and him (his family).</b> <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/074-sbt.php#008.074.255#008.074.255">8:74:255</a></div></div>
<p>We see that in addition to the personal hijab, a 'house hijab' is also required to separate the women of the house from visitors; in the form of a separating, opaque screen. Again as we see above this was a situational revelation. Muhammad was annoyed that people stayed and chatted with his wives after having dinner at the house, so Allah revealed a verse requiring a separation to put a damper on communication, thereby meaning guests do not stay as long before and after dinner. The above verses are not pertinent to the type of hijab being covered in this article, but have been presented to further highlight the silly circumstances of many of these situational revelations; also to acknowledge that 'hijab' as mentioned in the Qur'an and ahadith do not always refer to the same thing.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The reason that Muslim women wear the hijab today is not a spiritual one, nor is it a matter of piety. Covering the hair/face cannot be considered an act of modesty because Muslim men are not required to cover theirs. The sole reason they do it is because Umar bin Al-Khattab, a <a href="wiki/Sahabah.html" title="Sahabah">companion</a> of Prophet Muhammad, wished that he would reveal verses from Allah requiring women to wear it. When Muhammad did not oblige, Umar did not consider praying to Allah for assistance. Umar knew he had to make it personal for Muhammad himself in order to bring the revelation down. He followed Muhammad's wives out when they went to go to the toilet and made his presence known.  When Muhammad heard of this, the revelation that Umar had so wanted was sent down from Allah. Umar knew where these revelations were really coming from, which is why he went to Muhammad and harassed his wives instead of asking Allah. 
</p><p>Although the revelational circumstances for the hijab may seem comical, the consequences that we can see to this day, are not. The requirement for the hijab has had the effect of placing full responsibility for Muslim-male self control onto the females - freeing the men of responsibility for their actions if they see an unveiled woman. Lack of self control is not an inherent attribute to men, because men in non-Islamic societies generally do not have such self control issues; when it is rare to see a woman covered so in these societies. The hijab's purpose, as revealed and to this day, is designed to protect Muslim females from the now acceptable behavior of Muslim males; behavior which has been deemed socially acceptable precisely because of the requirement of Muslim females to wear the hijab.
