Beware, <b>a Muslim must not be killed for an infidel,</b> nor must one who has been given a covenant be killed while his covenant holds. If anyone introduces an innovation, he will be responsible for it.

<div class="quotes">Narrated Bashir, the Client of the Apostle of Allah: Bashir's name in pre-Islamic days was Zahm ibn Ma'bad. When he migrated to the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him). He asked: What is your name? He replied: Zahm. He said: No, you are Bashir. He (Bashir) said: When I was walking with the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) he passed by the graves of the polytheists. He said: They lived before (a period of) abundant good. He said this three times. He then passed by the graves of Muslims. He said: They received abundant good. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) suddenly saw a man walking in shoes between the graves. He said: O man, wearing the shoes! Woe to thee! Take off thy shoes. So the man looked (round), When he recognized the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him), he took them off and threw them away.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/020-sat.php#020.3224#020.3224">20:3224</a> , See Also <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/020-sat.php#020.3225#020.3225">20:3225</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">First of all, you should know that <b>a Muslim should not be killed for killing a belligerent non-Muslim according to the consensus of the scholars  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  them. According to the view of the majority of the scholars  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  them a Muslim should not be killed against a free non-Muslim under the Muslim rule.</b> The evidence about this is the saying of the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ): 
<p>&quot;A Muslim should not be killed for killing a non-Muslim.&quot; [At-Tirmithi]
</p><p>Moreover, according to the view of the majority of the scholars  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  them the title (and rulings) “disbeliever” is applicable to a free non-Muslim under the Muslim rule. However, Abu Haneefah, and the scholars of his School of jurisprudence  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  them are of the view that a Muslim should be killed for killing a free non-Muslim under Muslim rule; their evidence is the two verses which the questioner mentioned. 
</p><p>Nonetheless, <b>the correct opinion is that of the majority of the scholars  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  them that is based on the above Prophetic narration, which is a direct proof related to the case of dispute</b>.

<div class="quotes">Allah said, (until they pay the Jizyah), if they do not choose to embrace Islam, (with willing submission), in defeat and subservience, (and feel themselves subdued.), disgraced, humiliated and belittled.

<p>Muslim recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said, &quot;Do not initiate the Salam to the Jews and Christians, and if you meet any of them in a road, force them to its narrowest alley.&quot; This is why the Leader of the faithful `Umar bin Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, demanded his well-known conditions be met by the Christians, <b>these conditions that ensured their continued humiliation, degradation and disgrace.</b>

This is a document to the servant of Allah `Umar, the Leader of the faithful, from the Christians of such and such city. When you (Muslims) came to us we requested safety for ourselves, children, property and followers of our religion. We made a condition on ourselves that we will neither erect in our areas a monastery, church, or a sanctuary for a monk, nor restore any place of worship that needs restoration nor use any of them for the purpose of enmity against Muslims. We will not prevent any Muslim from resting in our churches whether they come by day or night, and we will open the doors [of our houses of worship] for the wayfarer and passerby. Those Muslims who come as guests, will enjoy boarding and food for three days. We will not allow a spy against Muslims into our churches and homes or hide deceit [or betrayal] against Muslims. We will not teach our children the Qur'an, publicize practices of Shirk, invite anyone to Shirk or prevent any of our fellows from embracing Islam, if they choose to do so. <b>We will respect Muslims, move from the places we sit in if they choose to sit in them. We will not imitate their clothing, caps, turbans, sandals, hairstyles, speech, nicknames and title names, or ride on saddles, hang swords on the shoulders, collect weapons of any kind or carry these weapons. We will not encrypt our stamps in Arabic, or sell liquor. We will have the front of our hair cut, wear our customary clothes wherever we are, wear belts around our waist, refrain from erecting crosses on the outside of our churches and demonstrating them and our books in public in Muslim fairways and markets. We will not sound the bells in our churches, except discretely, or raise our voices while reciting our holy books inside our churches in the presence of Muslims, nor raise our voices [with prayer] at our funerals, or light torches in funeral processions in the fairways of Muslims, or their markets. We will not bury our dead next to Muslim dead, or buy servants who were captured by Muslims. We will be guides for Muslims and refrain from breaching their privacy in their homes.' </b> When I gave this document to `Umar, he added to it, 'We will not beat any Muslim. These are the conditions that we set against ourselves and followers of our religion in return for safety and protection. If we break any of these promises that we set for your benefit against ourselves, then our Dhimmah (promise of protection) is broken and you are allowed to do with us what you are allowed of people of defiance and rebellion.' &quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=9&tid=20986?sid=9&tid=20986">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah 9 (Al-Tauba)</a></div></div>
