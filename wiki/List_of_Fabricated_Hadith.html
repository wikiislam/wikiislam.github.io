<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Narrating_Unverified_Hadith">Narrating Unverified Hadith</span></h2>
<p>Some apologists have started to reject <a href="wiki/Sahih.html" title="Sahih">sahih</a> (authentic) and hasan (good) hadith (for example, the narations concerning <a href="wiki/Authenticity_of_72_Virgins_Hadith.html" title="Authenticity of 72 Virgins Hadith">72 virgins</a>), in favour of maudu (fabricated) or da`if (weak) ones. Some of these hadith are obvious fabrications which do not have any scriptural sources. For a Muslim to propagate such a hadith is attributing a lie to the Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, thus it is a major sin deserving of <a href="wiki/Hell.html" title="Hell">hell-fire</a>.

<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i> What is the ruling regarding narrating stories I have heard, but am unaware as to their authenticity, in the path of da’wah to some people, and likewise narrating stories which I know are fabricated (lies)? And what is the ruling regarding narrating a hadeeth whilst I do not know whether it is authentic or weak?
<p><i>Answer:</i> It is not permissible for a person, a storyteller or one who gives advice, to narrate a hadeeth and attribute it to the Messenger (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) whilst he does not know if it is authentic. And it is (also) not permissible for him to narrate a hadeeth whilst he knows it to be weak. However, if he narrates a weak hadeeth to reveal it’s weakness and warn the people from it, then that is obligatory.
</p>
Likewise, he should not narrate stories which he assumes are worthy (of being narrated) without checking (their authenticity), and he should not narrate stories which he knows are fabricated, because that is being dishonest and deceiving the people.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes">Spreading da’wah messages and letters which contain explanations of shar’i rulings, or preaching and beneficial stories, is an important means of doing good, because many people receive them, and it is easy to send them. But we should make sure that the content is sound and that the ahaadeeth contained in it are saheeh (sound), because some people are abusing this great blessing (of easy communication) and are spreading fabricated ahaadeeth and false stories. <br><br>It is not permissible for anyone to say, “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said…” when he knows that the hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated) or false. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” ... It is haraam to narrate a fabricated hadeeth for one who knows that it is fabricated or who thinks it most likely that it is fabricated. Whoever narrates a hadeeth which he knows or thinks it most likely to be fabricated, and does not explain that it is fabricated, is included in this warning and is included among those who tell lies about the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><br> </div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Seeking_knowledge_is_a_duty_upon_every_Muslim">Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim</span></h3>
<p>This hadith has been classed by many as da`if (weak).
</p>
<div class="quotes">This hadith has many chains of narrations of the authority of more than a dozen Companions, including twenty Successors apparently reporting from Ans alone. They are collected by Ibn Majah, al-Bahihaqi, al-Tabarani and others, but all of them are da'if, according to Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahuwaih, Ibn Abd al-Barr and others, although some scholars authenticated a few of the chains. Al-Baihaqi said that its text is mashhur while its isnad is da'if, while al-Hakim and Ibn al-Salah regarded it as a prime example of a mashhur hadith which is not sahih. However, it is regarded by later sholars of Hadith as having enough chains of narration to be strengthened to the level of hasan or sahih, a view which is stated by al-Mizzi, al-Iraqi, Ibn Hajr, al-Suyuti and al-Albani.<sup id="cite_ref-Suhaib_Hassan_4-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-Suhaib_Hassan-4">[4]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Kashf al-Khafa, no. 1665: Sahih al-Jami al-Saghir, no. 3913-4</div></div>
<p>Weak or not, the knowledge which this narration is referring to is knowledge of the Islamic shari’ah, not knowledge in general.
</p>
<div class="quotes">What is meant by knowledge here is knowledge of sharee’ah (Islamic knowledge). Al-Thawri said: “It is the knowledge for which no person has any excuse for not knowing.” And Allaah knows best.<sup id="cite_ref-Islam_QA_13637_5-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-Islam_QA_13637-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Umar_corrected_by_a_woman">Umar corrected by a woman</span></h3>
<p>The following hadith, where Umar attempts to limit the <a href="wiki/Mahr.html" title="Mahr">Mahr</a>, is sometimes used to claim that women were politically and socially active in early Islamic societies.
</p>
<div class="quotes">'Umar ibn al-Khattab...stated that if anyone pays more as dower than what the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to pay, he would put that excess amount in the Public Treasury. A woman from the Quraish came to him and said, &quot;O commander of the Faithful, does the Book of Allah have more right to be followed or your statement? He said, &quot;The Book of Allah.&quot; So she then told him, &quot;You have just prohibited the people from giving an excessive amount for dower but Allah has stated in His Book,&quot;And if you have given them a great amount of gold as dower, take not the least bit of it back.'&quot; [4:20] And then 'Umar said two or three times, &quot;Everybody has a better understanding than 'Umar.&quot; [Other narrations state, &quot;The Woman is correct and 'Umar is mistaken.&quot; - Footnote] Then he got back on the minbar and said, &quot;O people, I used to forbid you from being excessive with respect to the dower of women. Verily a man may do whatever he sees fit with his wealth.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Umar2_6-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-Umar2-6">[6]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>This hadith has been classed as da`if (weak). It also contradicts authentic hadith which state Umar did in fact limit excessive payments of Mahr.
</p>
<div class="quotes">This story was narrated by both al-Baihaqi in Sunan al-Kubra and Abdul Razzaq in al-Mussanaf. The chains of both al-Baihaqi and of Abdul Razzaq are weak. Al-Baihaqi, in fact, points out taht the chain he records is broken. [Abu Bakr al-Baihaqi, Sunan al Kubra, Beirut, Dar al-Fikr, nd., vol 7, p 233] Indeed, al-Baihaqi seems to prefer another narration from Umar that he recorded just prior to the above narration. In that narration, it states that Umar said that he had intended to put a limit on women's dowers until he read the verse, &quot;A great amount of gold as dower.&quot; Commenting on this narration, al-Baihaqi said, &quot;It is a good mursal chain.&quot; [Footnote: Mursal means the link between Umar and the one who narrated from him is broken.]
<p>Al-Albani points out that not only are the chains of al-Baihaqi and Abdul Razzaq weak because they are broken, they also contain weak narrators that further weakens their chains. Hence, he concludes that this narration from Umar ibn al-Khattab is definitely weak. [Footnote: Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, Irwa al-Ghalil fi Takhrij Ahadit Manar al-Sabeel Beirut, al-Maktab al-Islami, 1979, vol 6, p 347.]
</p><p>Indeed, it is confirmed in authentic hadith recorded by Abu Dawud, al-Nasai, al-Tirmidhi and others that Umar ibn al-Khattab did in fact advise the people not to be excessive when it comes to a woman's dower.
</p>
Actually, the above incident from the time of Umar ibn al-Khattab is quoted by many people nowadays to demonstrate that women used to take part in the political and other activities during the time of the Companions. They had an active role in society and, as one speaker today called it, took part in the &quot;congressional meetings&quot; (!) held in the mosque during those times. They go from that to exhorting women to take much more attractive roles in society and not be content with being at home, being good wives and mothers. They say that this was not the practice during the time of the Companions as this incident from the time of' Umar ibn al-Khattab clearly demonstrates. Obviously, in order to use such an incident as proof, one must first prove the authenticity of the narration. This is not possible in this case and, therefore, this incident cannot be used as a proof.<sup id="cite_ref-Umar2_6-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-Umar2-6">[6]</a></sup><br> </div>

<div class="quotes">There is a Hadith related by a group of people which states that the Prophet [peace be upon him] said after the battle of Tabuk: 'We have returned from Jihad Asghar [lesser jihad] to Jihad Akbar [greater jihad].' This hadith has no source, nobody whomsoever in the field of Islamic Knowledge has narrated it. Jihad against the disbelievers is the most noble of actions, and moreover it is the most important action for the sake of mankind.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><br> </div>

<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i> 
<p>Is Jihad in the way of Allah the same level regardless of whether it is with one's life, wealth , or supplication , even if somebody is capable of the type that involves one's life?
</p><p><i>Answer:</i>
</p>
There are different kinds of jihad - with one's self, wealth, supplication, teaching, giving guidance, or helping others in good in any form.The highest form of jihad, however, is with one's life (the intent here is not suicide, for that is forbidden in Islam), then comes Jihad with one's wealth and jihad with teaching and guidance, and in this way Da'wah is a form of jihad, but jihad with one's life is the highest form.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz, Fatawa Islamiyah Vol:8 p. 24</div></div>

<div class="quotes">O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today.
<p>O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every *Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that He will indeed reckon your deeds. God has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. God has judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...
</p><p>Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.
</p><p>O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under God's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.
</p><p>O People, listen to me in earnest, worship God, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.
</p><p>All mankind is from Adam and Eve, <b>an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white</b> except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.
</p><p>Remember, one day you will appear before God and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.
</p><p>O People, no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Quran and my Ahl al-Bayt and if you follow these you will never go astray.
</p>
All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O God, that I have conveyed your message to your people<br> </div>

<div class="quotes">O people, listen to my words. I do not know whether I shall ever meet you again in this place after this year. O people, your blood and your property are sacrosanct until you meet your Lord, just as this day and this month of yours are sacred. Surely you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your deeds. I have [already] made this known. Let he who has a pledge return it to the one who entrusted him with it; all usury is abolished, but your capital belongs to you. Wrong not and you shall not be wronged. Allah has decreed that there will be no usury, and the usury of Abbas b. Abd al-Muttalib is abolished, all of it. All blood shed in the pre-Islamic days is to be left unavenged. The first such claim I revoke is that of Ibn Rabiah b. al-Harith b. Abd al-Muttalib, who was nursed among the Banu Layth and was slain by the Banu Hudhayl. His is the first blood shed in the pre-Islamic days with which I shall set an example. O people, indeed Satan despairs of ever being worshipped in this land of yours. He will be pleased, however, if he is obeyed in a thing other than that, in matters you minimize. So beware of him in your religion, O people, intercalculating a month is an increase in unbelief whereby the unbelievers go astray; one year they make it profane, and hallow it another [in order] to agree with the number that Allah has hallowed, and so profane what Allah has hallowed, and hallow what Allah has made profane. Time has completed its cycle [and is] as it was on the day that Allah created the heavens and the earth. The number of the months with Allah is twelve; [they were] in the Book of Allah on the day He created the heavens and the earth. Four of them are sacred, the three consecutive [months] and the Rajab [which is the month of] Mudar, which is between Jumada and Sha’ban. <br><br>Now then, O people, you have a right over your wives and they have a right over you. You have [the right] that they should not cause anyone of whom you dislike to tread on your beds; and that they should not commit any open indecency. <b>If they do, then Allah permits you to shut them in separate rooms and to beat them</b>, but not severely. If they abstain from [evil], they have the right to their food and clothing in accordance with the custom. Treat women well, <b>for they are [like] domestic animals with you and do not possess anything for themselves.</b> You have taken them only as a trust from Allah, and you have made the enjoyment of their persons lawful by the word of Allah, so understand and listen to my words, O people. I have conveyed the Message, and have left you with something which, if you hold fast to it, you will never go astray; that is, the Book of Allah and the sunnah of his Prophet. Listen to my words, O people, for I have conveyed the Message and understand [it]. Know for certain that every Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, and that all Muslims are brethren. It is not lawful for a person [to take] from his brother except that which he has given him willingly, so do not wrong yourselves. O Allah, have I not conveyed the message?<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_IX:_The_Last_Years_of_the_Prophet" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 9, pp. 112-113</a></div></div>
<p>The claim that &quot;an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab&quot; also contradicts mainstream Islamic beliefs:
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>The fact that Allah Most High has chosen the Arabs over other nations is affirmed in rigorously authenticated hadiths of the Prophet</b>, may Allah bless him and give him peace; related by Bukhari and Muslim in their “Sahih” in the beginning of the chapter of merits, # 5897, on the authority of Wathilah ibn al-Asqa` who said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, ‘Verily Allah has chosen Kinanah from the son of Isma`il, and He has chosen Quraysh from among Kinanah and He has chosen Hashim from among Quraysh and He has chosen me from the Bani Hashim.’”
<p>So this hadith is a primary text about <b>the preference of Arabs over others and the preference of some Arabs over other Arabs</b>. And this is what the Imams have chosen from the………of their books, and even in individual books such as the book of Qurb about the merit of Arabs, authored by the great Imam al-Hafiz Zayn al-din al-`Iraqi. And it was summarized by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Hajar al-Haytami and others.
</p><p><b>Therefore the preference of Arabs over other nations, and the preference of some Arabs over other Arabs is affirmed in the Sacred Law.</b> Allah has even preferred some months over other months and some days and nights of over others, as well as places. So in the same way, Allah Glorious and Exalted is He, has chosen some men over others, such as the prophets over others and even some prophets over other prophets. Muslims should not have any objection to this, because all of this returns to the wisdom of the Most Wise, Glorious is He, who is not asked about what He does, but rather, they are the ones who are asked. So after a Muslim has believed in Allah as his Lord, the Truth, and that there is no God but Him, then he should know that this is from among His matters, Blessed and High is He, and there is nothing but magnificent wisdom in it that we might see or that we might not see. Either way, we are only responsible for submitting to His rule, Glorious is He. And among His rulings is that Arabs are preferred over others and that some Arabs are better than other Arabs, as the above hadith clearly explained. <b>So it is not appropriate for anyone to disagree in this when the proof is perfectly valid.</b>
</p><p>And there should be no disagreement in what has just preceded nor any disagreement in what appears in the Magnificent Book and in the sunna where we find that the real source of Allah’s preference is God-fearingness (taqwa) which result in the good deeds that people earn and that they are accounted for. So whoever sends forth good for himself, Allah has preferred him over those who have sent forth evil. As for the preference of an Arab over a non-Arab, and the preference of some Arabs over others, this is not a deed that one can earn. Rather, it is a bounty that Allah gives to whom He wills. So he may will something for these people, and there is no objection to your Lord’s rule. This is like the preference of some days over others, because the mind reasons that all days are the same in and of themselves, and there is no distinction that might appear between them. However, the mind can understand why something is better if there is not ……….. So the Sacred law came and affirmed the preference of some over others, and for some of those things there were reasons and wisdoms, such as the preference of the night of Power over others because the Majestic Qur’an was revealed during it. And in some of these things, the wisdom is not apparent to us and so this falls into the chapter of absolute obedience, such as the number of cycles (rak`ahs) in the prayer.
</p><p><b>It is obligatory on a Muslim to believe that Arabs are preferred over other nations because there is a proof for it.</b> However, this is not one of the pillars of our religion such that if someone rejected this, they would be considered outside of Islam. But if one does reject this, one has sinned for not believing in it because it is an affirmed matter according to a clear rigorously authenticated hadith. Also, this issue is not something that is commonly known among most Muslims, so for this, one should not hasten to blame one who disagrees with it. It is necessary, rather, to tell him about the issue.
</p><p>And the fact that Arabs are preferred over others does not mean that a non-Arab can not have a higher merit in the religion than an Arab, because a person earns the good deeds that Allah has recommended we compete for. This is the highest merit of God-fearingness and this will be the basis upon which things are decided in the hereafter. However, <b>the merit of the Arabs will still remain, in terms of their respect and exaltation being higher than others</b>. And from this some hadiths have come to us about the Quraysh being put first for the caliphate before others, such as the hadith in Bukhari (#3500) on the authority of Mu`awiyah, may Allah be well pleased with him who said, ” I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, ‘This matter of government belongs to the Quraysh. Anyone who takes a hostile attitude to them will be thrown on his face, as long as they are true to the faith.” And Bukhari also related (#3501) on the authority of Ibn `Umar from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and give him peace, that he said, “Government continues to belong to the Quraysh, even if they are (no more than) two.”
</p>
So I say that the merit of God-fearingness is what counts, according to the rigorously authenticated hadith, “And he who is slow in doing good deeds, his noble lineage will not quicken him (into entering Paradise).<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><br> </div>

&quot;This is one of the most incorrect sayings possible, since if ikhtilaaf were a mercy, then agreement would be a punishment, something which no Muslim would say, because there can only be agreement or disagreement, and there can only be mercy or punishment.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shaykh al-Albaani, Silsilah al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah wa'l-Mawdoo`ah (58-62)</div></div>

Rather I wanted to raise your status on this Day. Go to the place where the people are standing, and whoever gave you a piece of bread, or water to drink, or clothes to wear, take him to Paradise .’” The shaykh said: this report is a lie which was not narrated by any of the scholars of hadeeth.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad.27s_parents_brought_to_life_so_they_could_go_to_heaven">Muhammad's parents brought to life so they could go to heaven</span></h4>
<p>According to sahih narrations, Muhammad's parents, and even his supportive uncle,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> are in eternal hell-fire. Anything to the contrary (i.e. claims that they were brought back to life so they could die as Muslims and go to heaven) have been classed as fabricated or very weak.
</p>
<div class="quotes">There is no saheeh hadeeth which says that Allaah, may He be exalted, brought the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) back to life, and that they believed in him then died. Rather the saheeh ahaadeeth that have been narrated indicated that they died in kufr and that they are among the people of Hell.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes">This view [that the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will be saved (from Hell), and that Allaah brought them back to life after they had died and they believed in him] was rejected by the majority of scholars who ruled that the ahaadeeth which indicate that are fabricated (mawdoo’) or very weak (da’eef jiddan). 
<p>It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood: 
</p><p>Most of the reports that been narrated to the effect that the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were brought back to life and believed in him and were saved are fabricated and false. Some of them are very weak and cannot be saheeh under any circumstances, as the imams of hadeeth are unanimously agreed that they are fabricated, such as al-Daaraqutni, al-Jawzaqaani, Ibn Shaheen, al-Khateeb, Ibn ‘Asaakir, Ibn Naasir, Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Suhayli, al-Qurtubi, al-Muhibb, al-Tabari, Fath al-Deen ibn Sayyid al-Naas, Ibraaheem al-Halabi and others. The scholar Ibraaheem al-Halabi explained at length the fact that the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have not been saved from Hell in a separate essay, as did ‘Ali al-Qaari in Sharh al-Fiqh al-Akbar and in a separate essay. The basis for this opinion is the  soundness of this hadeeth (“My father and your father are in Hell”). Shaykh Jalaal al-Deen al-Suyooti differed from the huffaaz and scholars and affirmed that they had believed and had been saved, and he wrote numerous essays on that topic, including al-Ta’zeem wa’l-Minnah fi anna Abaway Rasool-Illaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fi’l-Jannah. 
</p><p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there any saheeh report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that Allaah brought his parents back to life so that they could become Muslims, then they died (again) after that? 
</p><p>He replied: There is no saheeh report to that effect from the scholars of hadeeth. Rather the scholars are agreed that this is an invented lie… There is no dispute among the scholars that this is one of the most obvious of fabrications, as was stated by those who have knowledge. That does not appear in any of the reliable books of hadeeth, either in the Saheehs or the Sunans or the Musnads or any other well-known books of hadeeth. It was not mentioned by the authors of the books of Maghaazi or Tafseer, even though they narrated da’eef (weak) reports along with saheeh (sound) ones. The fact that this is a lie is clear to any one who has any knowledge of religion. If such a thing had happened there would have been a great deal of motivation to transmit it, because it is something that is extraordinary on two counts: the raising of the dead and believing after death. Such a thing would have been more deserving of being transmitted than anything else. Since no trustworthy narrated transmitted it, it may be understood that this is a lie. 
</p><p>Moreover, this goes against the Qur’aan and the saheeh Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“Allaah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom Allaah will forgive and Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise.
</p><p>18. And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent;’ nor of those who die while they are disbelievers”
</p><p>[al-Nisa’ 4:17-18] 
</p><p>So Allaah states that there is no repentance for one who dies as a disbeliever. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“Then their Faith (in Islamic Monotheism) could not avail them when they saw Our punishment. (Like) this has been the way of Allaah in dealing with His slaves. And there the disbelievers lost utterly (when Our Torment covered them)”
</p><p>[Ghaafir 40:85]
</p><p>So He tells us that the way in which He deals with His slaves is that faith will be to no avail once they have seen the punishment, so how about after death? And there are other similar texts. Then he quoted the two hadeeth which we quoted at the beginning of our answer.
