<p>The following issues show that in fact the Quran is missing details about many topics or important aspects of Islam.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ablution">Ablution</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken, till ye know that which ye utter, nor when ye are polluted, save when journeying upon the road, till ye have bathed. And if ye be ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have touched women, and ye find not water, then go to high clean soil and rub your faces and your hands (therewith).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.043#004.043">4:43</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">O ye who believe! when ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; Rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. If ye are in a state of ceremonial impurity, bathe your whole body. But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands,<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.006#005.006">5:6</a></div></div>
<p>The purpose of this excessive (ritual) cleanliness is omitted, and more details concerning <a href="wiki/Ablution.html" title="Ablution">ablution</a> before daily prayers can be found in the <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abu_Lahab">Abu Lahab</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Perish the hands of the Father of Flame(Abu Lahab)! Perish he! No profit to him from all his wealth, and all his gains! Burnt soon will he be in a Fire of Blazing Flame! His wife shall carry the (crackling) wood - As fuel!- A twisted rope of palm-leaf fibre round her (own) neck!<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/111-qmt.php#111.001#111.001">111:1-5</a></div></div>
<p>It is not possible to learn who Abu Lahab is and why he and his wife are damned to hell without referencing hadith, thus leaving the entire 111<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Qur'an without a point.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Blowing_on_Knots">Blowing on Knots</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn, From the mischief of created things; From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads; From the mischief of those who blow on knots; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/113-qmt.php#113.001#113.001">113:1-4</a></div></div>
<p>Many translators identify those who blow on knots as &quot;those who practice secret arts&quot; or <a href="wiki/Witchcraft.html" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, but this information is not found within the actual Qur'anic text. Others choose to translate it accurately as &quot;those who blow on knots&quot;, which makes it impossible to identify who these people are and why they would do such a thing.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Beast">Beast</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">And when the word is fulfilled concerning them, We shall bring forth a beast of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in Our revelations.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/027-qmt.php#027.082#027.082">27:82</a></div></div>
<p>The Qur'an does not elaborate on the beast, its physical appearance or how it would communicate with humans.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Color_of_Allah">Color of Allah</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">(We take our) colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring. We are His worshippers.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.138#002.138">2:138</a></div></div>
<p><a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>'s color or the meaning behind this phrase is not explained. Some translators replace &quot;colour&quot; with the term &quot;baptism&quot; but this information is not found within the actual Qur'anic text. It is taken from later interpretations by Qur'anic commentators.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Companions_of_the_Elephants">Companions of the Elephants</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Sees thou not how Allah dealt with the companions of the elephants? Did He not make their plan into misguidance? And he sent against them flights of birds.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/105-qmt.php#105.001#105.001">105:1-3</a></div></div>
<p>No details about this battle are available.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah's messenger - they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.157#004.157">4:157</a></div></div>
<p>The lack of detail in this verse has led to different Muslim opinions on Jesus' death with some calling it an illusion, some saying he was immortal and only appeared dead and others saying he was replaced by a look-alike on the cross.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_of_Congregation">Day of Congregation</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">O ye who believe! When the call is heard for the prayer of the day of congregation, haste unto remembrance of Allah and leave your trading. That is better for you if ye did but know.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/062-qmt.php#062.009#062.009">62:9</a></div></div>
<p>The &quot;day of congregation&quot; refers to the day which Muslims gather (usually at a <a href="wiki/Mosque.html" title="Mosque" class="mw-redirect">mosque</a>) to perform a congregational <a href="wiki/Prayers.html" title="Prayers">prayer</a>. Other translators add &quot;the Friday prayer&quot; (i.e. Jumu'ah) to this verse, but this information is not found within the actual Qur'anic text.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">They ask thee concerning Zul-qarnain Say, &quot;I will rehearse to you something of his story.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/018-qmt.php#018.083#018.083">18:83</a></div></div>
<p>The story of <a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn.html" title="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</a> continues on for many verses but nowhere does it mention who he is, only that he appears to be a historical figure. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Exalted_Assembly">Exalted Assembly</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">We have indeed decked the lower heaven with beauty (in) the stars,-  (For beauty) and for guard against all obstinate rebellious evil spirits,  (So) they should not strain their ears in the direction of the Exalted Assembly but be cast away from every side,<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/037-qmt.php#037.006#037.006">37:6-8</a></div></div>
<p>There is no explanation provided concerning who this Exalted Assembly consists of, nor any explanation of their function.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Examining_Women">Examining Women</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">O ye who believe! When believing women come unto you as fugitives, examine them. Allah is Best Aware of their faith. Then, if ye know them for true believers, send them not back unto the disbelievers. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/060-qmt.php#060.010#060.010">60:10</a></div></div>
<p>How to examine these women is not explained, nor is the criteria for passing a positive or negative judgment.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Exile">Exile</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces). Little did ye think that they would get out: And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But the (Wrath of) Allah came to them from quarters from which they little expected (it), and cast terror into their hearts, so that they destroyed their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the Believers, take warning, then, O ye with eyes (to see)!<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/059-qmt.php#059.002#059.002">59:2</a></div></div>
<p>These unbelievers are the Banu Nadir, but their identity cannot be known without the <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsirs</a>. What caused them to destroy their own homes is also not explained other than it being attributed to Allah.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fasting">Fasting</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil). For a <b>certain number</b> of days; but whoever among you is sick or on a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; and those who are not able to do it may effect a redemption by feeding a poor man; so whoever does good spontaneously it is better for him; and that you fast is better for you if you know. The month of Ramazan is that in which the Quran was revealed, a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction; therefore whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire for you difficulty, and (He desires) that you should complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of Allah for His having guided you and that you may give thanks.....It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.183#002.183">2:183-187</a></div></div>
<p>Though there seems to be an adequate amount of detail, the certain number of days is not given (the length of the lunar month varies, so does its first day across the globe). Either the sighting of the <a href="wiki/Crescent_Moon.html" title="Crescent Moon">crescent moon</a> or astronomical start of Ramadan should have been mentioned but both are missing. The rituals like recitation, prayers and Eid are also missing.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Five_Pillars">Five Pillars</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="wiki/Qur'an_Only_Islam_-_Why_it_is_Not_Possible.html#Five_Pillars_of_Islam" title="Qur'an Only Islam - Why it is Not Possible">Five Pillars of Islam</a> are central to Islam. This concept is not found in the Qur'an, but within the sirah and hadith, without which four of the Five Pillars would not exist. As an example, praying five times a day is considered very important. Yet the Qur'an does not mention that prayers should be said five times a day. It would take a lot more verses to create specifics for the five pillars. 
</p><p>This differs from most of the other entries on this list, in that it is not strictly a case of the Qur'an lacking detail. The Qur'an never claims there are Five Pillars. However, the Five Pillars form a fundamental part of Islam, and all forms of Islam accept the Qur'an as its holy text. Meaning that, for adherents, this difference is meaningless; they still have a holy text that claims to be detailed, yet fails to mention the most fundamental of Islamic concepts.

<p>Very little information is provided about who or what Gog and Magog are.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Harut.2C_Marut_and_the_Devils">Harut, Marut and the Devils</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">
<p><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) <i>against the power of Solomon:</i> the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: &quot;We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme.&quot; They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the <i>buyers of (magic)</i> would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew!
</p>
<b>Shakir:</b> And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, &quot;Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever.&quot; Even then men learned from <i>these two,</i> magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah's permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.102#002.102">2:102</a></div></div>
<p>Only the general message of this verse (not to disbelieve) can be understood. The rest of the story consists of unclear, inconsistent and abrupt sentences. There is not enough context provided concerning the angels and their place (Babel). Then they seem to be taking both sides, good and evil. By the end, the subject &quot;they&quot; becomes unclear.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hidden_Meanings">Hidden Meanings</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: &quot;We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord:&quot; and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/003-qmt.php#003.007#003.007">3:7</a></div></div>
<p>This verse claims the opposite of what verses 6:114, 41:3, 6:38 and 16:89 claim concerning clarity and detail. Which verses are allegorical is not specified. Some which look allegorical may have been intended as literal. Then this verse says there are hidden meanings which no one except Allah can understand. Thus the purpose of details is negated.

<div class="quotes">Glory to (Allah) Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,- in order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and seeth (all things).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/017-qmt.php#017.001#017.001">17:1</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples, &quot;Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah?&quot; Said the disciples, &quot;We are Allah's helpers!&quot; then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/061-qmt.php#061.014#061.014">61:14</a></div></div>
<p>This verse ends the surah without explaining what &quot;power&quot; (physical or spiritual) was provided to the Children of Israel and how this helped them prevail over the disbelievers. This verse also ignores that, according to Islam, Jesus's message was corrupted, hence his prophethood eventually failed.

<p>Little can be understood concerning the events surrounding Job. His distress and suffering, the location of where he struck his foot, where his people were, who or what he is supposed to strike with grass, the oath he took. None of these issues are explained.

<p>It is never explained who these &quot;makers&quot; are. Interpreters claim this to have referred to different historical events, such as the persecution of Axumite Christians by Dhu Nuwas in Yemen, the persecutions by Nebuchadnezzar II, or the Battle of the trench.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Lack_of_Detail_in_the_Quran.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

<div class="quotes">Muhammad is no more than a messenger: many Were the messenger that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then Turn back on your heels?

<div class="quotes">Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them.

<p>These are the only four verses that mention Muhammad by name, and the only information they provide about him is that he is a messenger of Allah. Without the hadith and sirah literature, almost nothing would be known about him (e.g. his birth, age, appearance, wives, children, death, and so on).

<p>There is no mention of who this Pharaoh is. Pharaohs were the rulers of Egypt and number in the hundreds. But the word &quot;Pharaoh&quot; is used as a proper noun whenever narrating the story of Exodus.

<div class="quotes">And Allah sets forth, as an example to those who believe the wife of Pharaoh: Behold she said: &quot;O my Lord!

<p>The previous verse condemns the wife of Noah and the wife of Lut to hell and the next verse praises Mary, but this verse fails to mention the fate of the wife of Pharaoh.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Piercing_Star">Piercing Star</span></h2>

<p>This verse claims it is explaining a star but fails to provide any details. One does not even know what particular star it is describing.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Runners">Runners</span></h2>

<p>The lack of context makes these verses difficult to understand. Other translators use parentheses to depict this as a scene of war because nothing is clear without them.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sabians">Sabians</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.062#002.062">2:62</a></div></div>
<p>Sabians cannot be identified and nothing more is known about them or their extinct religion. Later sources try to point out who they are.

<p>The verse implies that the seven verses are separate from the Qur'an. But what they are is not explained. Major translators write &quot;verses&quot; in parentheses, hence seven may have referred to something entirely different.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Solomon.27s_Throne">Solomon's Throne</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">And verily We tried Solomon, and set upon his throne a (mere) body. Then did he repent. He said: My Lord!

<p>Many unanswered questions emerge from this verse. For example, the identity of the body, the reason behind Solomon's repentance, and the possibility of him being responsible for the death of that body.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Balance">The Balance</span></h2>

<p>There are no details on how to judge repentance and what a thief should do to repent. It could be anything from apologizing to doing something as punishment, or a case where the thief repents just after stealing and promises never to steal.

<p>There are several variations of the translation of this verse for example &quot;two men&quot;, &quot;if the two of you&quot; and &quot;man and a woman&quot;. This ambiguity could have been easily avoided if Quran had been clear in saying whether it was two men or any thing else. <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Homosexuality.html#Tafsir_Quran_4_16" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Homosexuality">Tafsirs</a> confirm that the Quran is most likely referring to &quot;two men&quot;.
