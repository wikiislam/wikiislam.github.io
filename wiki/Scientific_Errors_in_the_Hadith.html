<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adam_was_a_90_foot_giant">Adam was a 90 foot giant</span></h3>
<p>The hadith say humans were created in the physical image of Allah. Thus they began as tall as 90ft giants (60 cubits is the equivalent of 90 feet), and have been decreasing in height ever since. The oldest human remains found in Ethiopia (Lucy and Ardi) were actually shorter in height than us, thus Archaeological science has disproved this belief.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Abu Huraira: 
The Prophet said, &quot;Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, &quot;Go and greet that group of angels, and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting (salutations of your offspring.&quot; So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, &quot;As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi&quot; (i.e. Peace and Allah's Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/055-sbt.php#004.055.543#004.055.543">4:55:543</a>, See also: <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/040-smt.php#040.6809#040.6809">40:6809 </a> and <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/032-smt.php#032.6325#032.6325">32:6325</a></div></div>

<p>The citations are taken from the Arabic version of Ibn Kathir’s <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">Tafsir</a>, since the English translation omits these traditions. As you begin to read them it will become obvious why these tales were omitted from the English version. The early Muslim traditions gives us an insight to Islamic views on the cosmos. Tafsir Tabari, Al Qurtubi and Ibn Abbas also give the same ideas.

<div class="quotes">It was said that <b>Nun refers to a great whale</b> that rides on the currents of the waters of the great ocean and <b>on its back it carries the severn Earths</b>, as was stated by Imam Abu Jafar Ibn Jarir. Narrated by Ibn Bashar, narrated by Yahya, narrated by Sufyan Al-Thuri, narrated by Sulayman Al-Amash, narrated by Abu Thubian, narrated by Ibn Abbas who related, &quot;The first thing that Allah created was the pen and He said to it ‘Write’. The pen asked, ‘What shall I write?’ Allah said, ‘Write (the) fate (of everything).’ So the pen wrote everything that shall be from that moment until judgment day.
<p>Then Allah created the &quot;Nun&quot; and He caused steam to rise out of which the heavens were created <b>and the Earth was then laid flat on nun’s back</b>. Then the Nun became nervous and (as a result) the earth began to sway, but <b>(Allah) fastened (the earth) with mountains lest the earth should move</b> ...
</p><p>It was narrated by Ibn Jarir, narrated by Ibn Hamid, narrated by Ata’a, narrated by Abu Al-Dahee, narrated by Ibn Abbas who stated, &quot;The first thing my Lord created, may He be Exalted and Glorified, was the pen and He said to it, ‘Write.’ So the pen wrote all that will be until judgment day. Then Allah created the Nun (the whale) above the waters and <b>he pressed the Earth into its back</b>.
</p><p>Al Tabarani narrated the same hadith above (from the prophet Muhammad) who narrated from Abu Habib Zaid Al-Mahdi Al Marouzi, narrated by Sa’id Ibn Yaqub Al-Talqani, narrated by Mu’amal Ibn Ismail, narrated by Hamad Ibn Zaid, narrated by Ata’a Ibn Al Sa’ib, narrated by Abu Al Dahee Muslim Ibn Subaih, narrated by Ibn Abbas who stated that the prophet – may peace and blessing be upon him and his family - said, &quot;The first things Allah created were the pen and the whale and He said to the pen ‘Write.’ The pen asked, ‘What shall I write?’ Allah replied, ‘Everything that shall be until judgment day.’ Then He said ‘Nun. By the Pen and by what they write.’ So Nun is the whale and al-Qalam is the pen&quot; ...
</p>
Ibn Abu Nujaih stated that Ibrahim Ibn Abu Bakir was informed by Mujahid who said, &quot;It was said that Nun is <b>the great whale who is underneath the seven Earths</b>.&quot; Furthermore, Al-Baghawy – may Allah rest his soul - and a group of commentators stated that on the back of this whale there is a great rock whose thickness is greater than the width of the heavens and the earth and <b>above this rock is a bull that has forty thousand horns.
