<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Testimony_of_Leaving_Islam">Testimony of Leaving Islam</span></h2>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="About_myself">About myself</span></h4>
<p>I am an Indian of 50 years old, nickname Mirza Ghalib, brought up in an orthodox family. And yes, I am an Atheist. I  was made to pray 5 times a day from the age of 7. There is a custom amongst all Muslims in India that every child should complete reading the 'Arabic' Quran, whether they understand it or not. The local arabic teachers who taught us arabic knew nothing about the meaning of the arabic words. None of us had the time to read and investigate Islam in our own language. Whatever we knew about islam was from the bluffings of our imaams and mullahs and we were afraid to ask any questions. Usually our mosques consist of illiterates, ignorants, the elderly and lazy fellows (who don’t care about a bright future for their family.) as its devotees. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_wrong_concept_of_Islam_in_India">The wrong concept of Islam in India</span></h4>
<p>It is compulsory for very young children of the fanatical Muslim families to pray 5 times a day and I’m amongst them. In Friday Quthbaas we were brain washed and made to believe that Muhammad was kind, merciful, generous and overall more than an angel. It was in this way that I had completed 30 years as a true, innocent Muslim. The only fortunate thing that happened during these 30 years of life is that I had completed my engineering studies successfully. This is because of my neighbours who were Hindus and Christians. They  inspired me in my studies. Usually Indian Muslims prefer to live among their community, where most of them are illiterates. Knowingly or unknowingly, my parents made this “mistake” to live among the “unbelievers”; which enabled me to complete my studies and think about the religion in later days.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Saudi_Arabia.3B_a_unique_part_of_the_world">Saudi Arabia; a unique part of the world</span></h4>
<p>In the year 1990 at the age of 30, I went to the sacred country Saudi Arabia with my family for a job as an engineer. This  visit opened my eyes. My strong beliefs about Islam, and my utmost respect toward the sacred country perished day after day during my stay in Saudi Arabia. It is not possible for me to explain the terrible experiences that I faced along with my fellow expatriates. I would needs at least 1,000 pages to explain. I will definitely write a book on my experiences in Saudi Arabia in the future. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Thanks_to_my_Saudi_colleagues">Thanks to my Saudi colleagues</span></h4>
<p>Prior to my visit to Saudi Arabia, I thought of myself as a perfect Muslim; one who prayed 5 times per day and fasted 30 days during Ramadan. What I found out though, was that I was wrong. It was shown to me by my Saudi Arabian manager (a Muthawwa - a religious person) as well as some of my Saudi colleagues. They showed me that my activities were not Islamic. I mingled with my Hindu and Christian colleagues; inviting their families to my house, visiting their houses with my family. This is a social custom in India. I was teased and tortured by the Saudi's for all my acts of humanity; they labelled them as &quot;unislamic&quot; and they advised me to read the Quran and the hadiths. As mentioned, my parents had taught me the Quran since I was 7 years old in &quot;Arabic&quot;, without me understanding the meaning of a single word. this is how all Indian Muslims can say we 'know' the Quran. I realized that I had not studied the meaning of the words in the Quran. During my very first vacation back to India, I purchased various translations of the Quran in English, urdu, Hindi and Tamil; all languages I can understand. On my return to Saudi Arabia, I read these translations seriously. In the very beginning of the 2nd Surah (Al Baqarah), we are told that the perfect Muslim is the one who believes everything that is written in the Quran. This made me laugh and I felt that the Quran is not for a free-thinking society.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad.27s_gifts_to_men_and_his_discrimination_towards_women">Muhammad's gifts to men and his discrimination towards women</span></h4>
<p>When I had completed reading, I came to the conclusion that the Quran had been copied from the Bible by someone who did not have indepth knowledge. It contains half-told biblical stories and repetitions of the same stories (sometimes several times). I knew this because I had read the bible several times during my schooling at a Christian missionary school. Apart from the biblical stories, Muhammad included verses to justify his inhumane attacks on caravans as well as their looting. Later on, he added the verses to justify his unholy sexual desires and inhumane attacks on the desert tribes to become the King of the Arabian Peninsula. The Quran clearly shows that Muhammad needed the help of his male followers to attack the neighbouring tribues and annex their territories into his own regime. Therefore, he bribed his male followers with lots of gifts, such as: 4 wives, countless captive slave girls and permitting them to loot and rape the innocent tribes. He showed a special hatred towards his female followers, as there is no use for them in succeeding his war missions. He addresses the women as the dwellers of hell, he snatched the rights that they enjoyed before embracing his cult; and he made their position less than a domestic animal; all this to satisfy his male followers. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Mistranslations_of_the_Quran">Mistranslations of the Quran</span></h4>
<p>When reading the translations of the Quran in different languages, I fund that there is an interpolation in many critical verses. The translators are afraid to translate the actual meanings of the rubbish verses, as they are aware that the civilized societies would not accept Muhammad's unholy concept of Islam. For example, the word &quot;Qatil&quot; is wrongly translated as &quot;fight.&quot; Fight by what? is it a verbal fight? A fight with ammunition? A legal fight? Or to kill? Which meaning of &quot;Qatil&quot; did Muhammad intend? &quot;Qatil&quot; means &quot;kill&quot; in Urdu, and Urdu is a mix of Arabic, Persian and Hindi.
</p><p>Similarly, when I read the urdu translations about the <a href="wiki/Virgins.html" title="Virgins">Hoor-e-een (sexy virgins)</a> it says that they wont have a physical body, but only a spiritual form. When I asked the Saudi Imaams, they said undoubtedly that this is the reward given to every male Muslim by Allah in paradise. When I asked the Saudi Mullahs about the rewards that are given to the Muslim women in paradise, they warned me not to go away from my Imaan (belief) by asking such ridiculous questions in favour of the women.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Innocent_and_Ignorant_Muslims">Innocent and Ignorant Muslims</span></h4>
<p>After coming back to India, I explained to my family members what I had learned about the real message of the Quran. None of them were ready to hear what I had to say about their holy book and their beloved prophet, as they were afraid that their Imaan would be destroyed if they listened to what I had to say. Nobody had shown either the courage or the interest to read the biography of Muhammad or read the translations of the Quran. They still recite the &quot;Arabic&quot; Quran each day, as usual. I wonder when the printers and the Mullah's will overcome their embarrassment, and print the biography of this bandit. Why do his followers in this modern time still feel embarrassed to learn the truth about him? Is there any hope to liberate these people from the bondage of Muhammad's dangerous cult?
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Our_mission_must_go_on_until_every_Muslim_is_freed">Our mission must go on until every Muslim is freed</span></h4>
<p>For the past 10 years in India, I have succeeded in convincing my wife and children, as well as two other youths about the truth of Islam. I will continue my mission in rescuing the innocent victims of Islam; the Muslims themselves.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="My_desire">My desire</span></h4>
<p>Mr. Ali Sina, it is unbelievable to me that a man (You are great) from Muslim community has shown this extraordinary courage in bulldozing this dangerous cult and doing an excellent but risky job for the entirety of humanity. I have been waiting for the past 20 years for this unbelievable dream to come true. It is my humble request to you that if you can organise the apostates of islam of each country to work jointly in well organised manner, we will be able to do better job in rescuing our fellow Muslims who are the first victims of their own belief.
