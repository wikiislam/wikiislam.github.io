<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Many articles have been written in response to the claim that the Qur'an is validated by the geological science concerning mountains. This article adds to these by addressing several newer points that have been adopted to justify the original claim or to evade contrary scientific evidence.
</p><p>Due to what some refer to as the ‘richness of the <a href="wiki/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> language,’ <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> such as <a href="wiki/I._A._Ibrahim.html" title="I. A. Ibrahim">I. A. Ibrahim</a> have been able to use the vague interpretations of several Qur'anic verses in their attempt to prove the scientific validity of the Qur'an. In this, they are backed by a Muslim geologist specializing in biostratification, Professor Zaghloul Raghib El Naggar, and a western surgeon, <a href="wiki/Dr..html" title="Dr." class="mw-redirect">Dr.</a> Maurice Bucaille.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Apologists.27_Debating_Technique">Apologists' Debating Technique</span></h3>
<p>There are two elements to this claim that the Qur'an had foreshadowed the scientific knowledge concerning mountains:
</p>
<ol><li>Mountains are pegs.</li>
<li>Mountains stabilize the crust or the earth.</li></ol>
<p>Some of the tactics that are used to argue their case are as follows:
</p>
<ol><li>If a word has multiple meanings or translations, they will choose the one that suits them best at the time, ignoring all the rest as if they never existed. </li>
<li>If unable to come up with a valid response, they will claim that only a genuine intimacy with Classical Arabic will enable the proper understanding of a given verse and then, rather ironically, proceed to argue in the English language. </li>
<li>They will add complexity to an otherwise ‘simple’ verse without explanation nor justification. An example is the extension from ‘peg’ to ‘isostacy’ to ‘stabilize the crust/lithosphere/earth’. </li>
<li>They will switch from the ‘literal’ to ‘metaphorical’ case whenever convenient. A sure sign of loss will be when they claim that the Qur'an is not a book of Science but <a href="wiki/Islam_and_Scripture.html" title="Islam and Scripture">Scripture</a>, despite previously or concurrently promulgating the validity of ‘Qur'anic Science’.</li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relevant_Verses_and_Terms">Relevant Verses and Terms</span></h3>
<p>The relevant Qur'anic verses are:

<div class="quotes"><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> He created the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; He set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and He scattered through it beasts of all kinds.

</p><p><b>Shakir:</b> He created the heavens without pillars as you see them, and put mountains upon the earth lest it might convulse with you, and He spread in it animals of every kind; and We sent down water from the cloud, then caused to grow therein (vegetation) of every noble kind.

</p><p><b>Rodwell:</b> Without pillars that can be seen hath He created the heavens, and on the earth hath thrown mountains lest it should move with you; and He hath scattered over it animals of every sort: and from the Heaven we send down rain and cause every kind of noble plant to grow up therein.

And We sent down water from the sky, thus We caused to grow all kinds of good plants.

<div class="quotes"><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> And the earth We have spread out (like a carpet); set thereon mountains firm and immovable; and produced therein all kinds of things in due balance.
<p><b>Pickthal:</b> And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused each seemly thing to grow therein.

<b>Transliteration:</b> Waal-arda madadnaha waalqayna feeha rawasiya waanbatna feeha min kulli shay-in mawzoonin<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/15/19/default.htm">Qur'an Text/Transliteration 15:19</a></div></div> 
<p>The relevant Arabic terms are: awtad for pegs/bulwarks/stabilizers/ projections;<sup id="cite_ref-Zakir_Naik_1-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-Zakir_Naik-1">[1]</a></sup> rawasiya for mountains, and tameeda for tumble/shake/quake/convulse/sway etc.<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_2-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-Campbell-2">[2]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Wehr translates this word as unshakable mountains. The Munjid says (al-jibal al-thawabat al-ruwasikh) firmly established, fixed mountains. The word comes from the root (arsa), the same root used for the Arabic word for anchor. To throw out or cast the anchor is (alqa almirsah). So instead of &quot;cast the anchor to keep the ship from moving&quot;, we have &quot;cast the mountains to keep the earth from shaking.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_2-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-Campbell-2">[2]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Dr. <a href="wiki/Zakir_Naik.html" title="Zakir Naik">Zakir Naik</a> translated awtad as stakes or pegs (like those used to anchor a tent).<sup id="cite_ref-Zakir_Naik_1-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-Zakir_Naik-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>The most pertinent verse is 16:15 transliterated as follows: 
</p>
<dl><dd><i>Waalqa fee al-ardi rawasiya an tameeda bikum waanharan wasubulan laAAallakum tahtadoona</i>. </dd></dl>
<p>Note the verse uses the word 'ard' which can be used to describe the Earth, its surface, or the ground in general, an example of apologetic language vagueness – meaning that it can refer to anything from the Earth, the crust, the lithosphere, the mantle or any combination of the above that suits the apologist's argument at the time. 
</p><p>Also note that the word ‘tameeda’ is claimed to refer to shaking or disturbance, as opposed to ‘zalzala’ which means ‘earthquake.’ A further dissection of this term will be given later. 
</p><p>Other interpretations of verse 21:31 are as follows: 
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Bewley:</b> We placed firmly embedded mountains on the Earth so it would not move under them... 
<p><b>Daryabadi:</b> And We have placed in the Earth firm mountains lest it should move away with them... 
</p><p><b>Hilali &amp; Khan:</b> And We have placed in the Earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them...
</p><p><b>Al-Muntakhab:</b> And We furnished the Earth with firm stays, mountains placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, to stabilize it lest it should sway you from side to side or in all directions... 
</p><p><b>Sarwar:</b> We placed firm mountains on Earth lest it would shake them away... 
</p>
<b>Asad:</b> And We have set up firm mountains on Earth lest it sway with them...<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/21/31/default.htm">Qur'an Text/Transliteration 21:31</a></div></div>
<p>There is another verse that may suggest that Mountains have roots, but only when apologists choose to use a certain definition in a typically vague verse: 
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> They ask thee concerning the Mountains: say, &quot;My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust; 
<p><b>Pickthal:</b> They will ask thee of the mountains (on that day). Say: My Lord will break them into scattered dust. 
</p><p><b>Shakir:</b> And they ask you about the mountains. Say: My Lord will carry them away from the roots. 
</p><p><b>Sher Ali:</b> And they ask thee concerning the mountains. Say, `My Lord will break them into pieces and scatter them as dust; 
</p><p><b>Khalifa:</b> They ask you about the mountains. Say, &quot;My Lord will wipe them out. 
</p><p><b>Palmer:</b> They will ask thee about the mountains; say, 'My Lord will scatter them in scattered pieces, 
</p><p><b>Sale:</b> They will ask thee concerning the mountains: Answer, my Lord will reduce them to dust, and scatter them abroad; 
</p><p><b>Rodwell:</b> And they will ask thee of the mountains: SAY: scattering my Lord will scatter them in dust; 
</p><p><b>&quot;Progressive Muslims&quot;:</b> And they ask you about the mountains, say: &quot;My Lord will annihilate them completely.&quot; 
</p>
<b>Transliteration:</b> Wayas-aloonaka AAani aljibali faqul yansifuha rabbee nasfan<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/20/105/default.htm">Qur'an Text/Transliteration 20:105</a></div></div> 
<p>Many translations translate the word 'yansifuha' as wipe out, break, carry away, annihilate, destroy, and crush, but apologists will prefer the meaning, ‘uproot’, as the Yusuf Ali and Al-Muntakhab versions have done.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Discussion">Discussion</span></h2>
<p>A summary of the apologetic case is as follows: 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mountains_have_deep_roots_thus_they_resemble_.E2.80.98pegs.E2.80.99">Mountains have deep roots thus they resemble ‘pegs’</span></h3>

The above schematic diagram is taken from &quot;Anatomy of the Earth&quot;, Cailleux, p. 220, and is cited by various Islamic <a href="wiki/Websites.html" title="Websites">websites</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-A_Brief_Illustrated_Guide_to_Understanding_Islam_3-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-A_Brief_Illustrated_Guide_to_Understanding_Islam-3">[3]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Superficially it would seem they have a point. Verse 78:6-7 says, “Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, And the mountains as pegs?” 
</p><p>They point to the fact of isostacy where the bulk of the mountain extends into the upper mantle as proof that Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> could not have known that mountains were ‘pegs’ staking the crust to the upper mantle unless <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> told him. 
</p><p>Sounds convincing? Herein lies the genius of the Qur'an – to make definitions so vague as to provide apologists with sufficient ‘wriggle room’.

The observation here is that they equate ‘deep mountain roots’ with ‘pegs’. There are several difficulties with this interpretation in that not all mountains have peg-like roots. An analysis of mountain formation reveals the fact that not all mountains have peg-like roots, for example volcanoes; those formed by extension and faulting (e.g. the Nevada Basin and Range); thrust and fold belts (e.g. Appalachians, Eastern Bolivian Andes, Zagros Mountain, the Calcareous Alps). A cross-section of the collisional Himalayas reveals a broad ‘wedge’ rather than Cailleux’s schematic ‘peg’ diagram,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> as do the Pyrenees.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The diagram below is a true scale cross section of the Andes mountain range. The mountains and their “roots” (which do not resemble “pegs” in the slightest) are in yellow.

<p><br>
Therefore it appears likely that they are mistaken when claiming mountains are pegs in the literal sense. They base their claims on a single, greatly exaggerated, schematic diagram and not from a more comprehensive survey of mountain types and genuine geological data. 
</p><p>For these reasons, it can be conceded that mountains are pegs only in the metaphorical sense, but definitely not in the literal sense. 
</p><p>They also seem incredulous that Muhammad should have known that mountains have 'roots', arguing that since the bulk of the mountain is below ground it is unobservable. Muhammad could only have referred to mountain roots (like pegs) from a divine source. However, this may not be true since ancient people already knew mountains have roots. For example, the ancient Hebrews seemed to have acquired this knowledge.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deep_roots_stabilize_the_earth_.28or_mountain_roots_act_as_pegs.29">Deep roots stabilize the earth (or mountain roots act as pegs)</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">The role of mountains as stabilizers for the Earth's crust can be clearly seen in their very deep roots, and can be justified by the fact that the motions of the lithospheric plates only come to halt when a continent collides with another, producing a collisional type mountain, which is believed to be the last phase in mountain-building. Without mountains, the movement of lithospheric plates would have been much faster and their collision more drastic. Even though mountains do act as retarders for the plate movements, they should not be understood to be an independent force or factor, because they are the very product of this motion in the first place.<br> </div>
<div class="quotes">Modern geologists describe the folds in the Earth as giving foundations to the mountains, and their dimensions go roughly one mile to roughly 10 miles. The stability of the Earth's crust results from the phenomenon of these folds.<br> </div> 
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_2">Analysis</span></h4>
<p>The author of this proposition seems to have confused Cause with Effect. In his example of continental-collisional type mountains, he failed to see that mountains are caused by tectonic plate collision and do not effect plate stabilization. 
</p><p>It is possible that the reason why lithospheric plates come to a (slow) halt is not due to mountains but due to the opposing plates. The author's proposition is akin to saying that in an automobile collision, the crushed engine compartment stabilizes the car during the crash. In reality, the crushed engine compartment (analogy = mountain) is the effect of the crash (analogy = tectonic plate collision). It does not stabilize the car during the collision. 
</p><p>In short, there is no scientific evidence that continental-collisional type mountains stabilize tectonic plates. All assertions to this effect are mere opinion without scientific foundations.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mountains_stabilize_the_earth_because_plate_movements_are_impeded_by_their_formation">Mountains stabilize the earth because plate movements are impeded by their formation</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">The sea-deep roots stabilize the continental masses (or plates), as plate motions are almost completely halted by their formation, especially when the mountain mass is finally entrapped within a continent as an old craton.<sup id="cite_ref-El_Naggar_7-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-El_Naggar-7">[7]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_3">Analysis</span></h4>
<p>Professor El Naggar also seems to have confused Cause and Effect. Plate motions are almost completely halted not by collisional-type mountain formation (effect) but by the opposing plates. 
</p><p>Further, this is merely Professor El Naggar’s opinion – a search of the his CV has singularly failed to find refereed scientific proof of his assertion. In fact, El Naggar’s scientific career is built on the study of biostratification, not on the evidence that mountains stabilize continental masses. The only references to Professor El Naggar on mountains are un-refereed Islamic conferences on supposed Islamic Science.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Therefore, El Naggar’s opinion is a classical example of the logical fallacy of Argumentum Ad Verecundiam. 
</p><p>If one were to accept such argumentum ad verecundiam, one would also have to accept Professor David A. Young’s opinion: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">While it is true that many mountain ranges are composed of folded rocks (and the folds may be of large scale) it is not true that the folds render the crust stable. The very existence of the folds is evidence of instability in the crust.<sup id="cite_ref-Zakir_Naik_1-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-Zakir_Naik-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>In other words, mountains do not keep the earth from shaking. Their formation caused and still causes the surface of the earth to shake.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mountain_stabilize_the_lithospheric_plates_by_sinking_into_the_asthenosphere">Mountain stabilize the lithospheric plates by sinking into the asthenosphere</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">The stabilization of lithospheric plates by mountains is effected by their sinking deeply into the zone of weakness of the Earth (the asthenosphere) as wooden pegs sink into the ground to stabilize the corners of a tent. Such a process of stabilization cannot take place without the presence of a viscous, plastic material under the outer rocky cover of the Earth, into which the mountains &quot;roots&quot; can float. In as much as the ship casts its anchor into the anchorage of a port to avoid the dangers of rolling and swaying by winds and waves, the Glorious Quran uses the term &quot;Rawasi&quot; (=moorings or firm anchors) to describe mountains. Such firm anchors do not only stabilize the lithospheric plates, but also the whole planet in its spinning around its own axis (nutation, recession, etc.).<sup id="cite_ref-El_Naggar_7-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-El_Naggar-7">[7]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_4">Analysis</span></h4>
<p>Again, this is only Professor El Naggar’s opinion and a confusion of cause and effect. To date, no one has provided the scientific evidence derived by Professor El Naggar or anyone else to prove mountains actually stabilize the lithospheric plates. 
</p><p>The available scientific evidence is that the continental plates are stabilized by craton keels. These are deep (60-300km) extensions of cratons into the mantle (far deeper than mountain roots). The formation of these craton roots or keels are unrelated to mountain formation.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> 
</p><p>In fact, cratons are stable regions of the earth's crust that are no longer subject to mountain building processes. These craton roots or keels were formed by depletion of basaltic elements into the asthenosphere, leading to less dense material that sinks deeper into the mantle due to the lower buoyancy (i.e. isostacy {of the crust, not mountains} at work). <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_5">Analysis</span></h4>
<p>As early as the 1920s, scientists noted that earthquakes are concentrated in very specific narrow zones (Wadati-Benioff zones). In 1954, French seismologist J.P. Rothé published this map showing the concentration of earthquakes along the zones indicated by dots and cross-hatched areas.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

<p><br>
Note how the earthquakes originate mainly from the edges of tectonic plates, including collisional mountain ranges and ocean trenches and ridges, thus suggesting that mountains do not stabilize the crust or the earth. 
</p><p>Further evidence is provided by a detailed look at the Himalayan mountain range which shows that it is closely associated with earthquakes, thus proving mountains do not prevent earthquakes.

<div class="quotes">Why do earthquakes happen here? 
The Indian subcontinent lies upon the Indian Plate. This plate is moving northward at about 5 centimetres per year and in doing so, collides with the Eurasian Plate. Upon the Eurasian Plate lie the Tibet plateau &amp; central Asia. <b>Due to this mammoth collision, the Himalayas are thrust higher and very many earthquakes are generated in the process. This is the cause of earthquakes from the Himalayas to the Arakan Yoma.</b> The same process, though involving the Indian Plate and the Burmese Micro-plate results in earthquakes in the Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands. Sometimes earthquakes of different magnitudes occur within the Indian Plate, in the peninsula and in adjoining parts of the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal. These arise due to localized systems of forces in the crust sometimes associated with ancient geological structures such as in the Rann of Kachchh.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://asc-india.org/menu/seismi.htm&date=2011-10-02?url=http://asc-india.org/menu/seismi.htm&date=2011-10-02">Seismicity of South Asia</a><br>Amateur Seismic Centre</div></div>

The Andes Mountains did not seem to prevent or stabilize this earthquake. In fact, it is the collision between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates that causes these earthquakes and raises the Andes mountains.

<div class="quotes">This is a convergent plate boundary, the plates move towards each other. The amount of crust on the surface of the earth remains relatively constant.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mountains_stabilize_the_earth_through_isostacy">Mountains stabilize the earth through isostacy</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_6">Analysis</span></h4>
<p>This is a classical misconception of George Airy’s model of Isostacy and the logical fallacy of “Composition” (i.e. generalization of the specific case to the general). Just because the mountains are themselves stabilized by isostacy does not mean that the mountains stabilize the earth or the crust by isostacy. Every element in the earth’s crust is governed by the same physical laws – in fact the crust ‘floats’ on the upper mantle and is thus self-stabilizing according to its own isostacy, not that of mountains. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Isostacy, which says that any vertical column of the earth above some deep level of &quot;compensation&quot; must have the same mass. This has to do with bouyancy forces and with the tendency of deep materials (the asthenosphere, for example) to flow in response to pressure differences.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2004-03/1079354119.Es.r.html&date=2011-10-02?url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2004-03/1079354119.Es.r.html&date=2011-10-02">Do plates with high moutains float higher then thosewithout moutains</a><br>David Smith, Director of Professional Development, MadSci Network, Earth Sciences, March 14, 2004</div></div>
<p>Therefore, isostacy stabilizes mountains. Isostacy also stabilizes the earth's crust. 
However, mountains do not stabilize the crust through isostacy. The crust stabilises itself through its own isostacy. Therefore, the stability of the crust, through 'crustal' isostacy, has nothing to do with mountains. It is only wishful thinking to extend this 'mountain-specific' isostacy to the crust (which has its own isostacy) because isostacy is an independent 'force or phenomenon' acting on the mountains as it independently does on the crust.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_term_.E2.80.98tameeda.E2.80.99_does_not_refer_to_earthquakes_but_to_shaking_or_disturbances">The term ‘tameeda’ does not refer to earthquakes but to shaking or disturbances</span></h3>
<p>When shown evidence that collisional-type mountains are associated with earthquakes some Muslims will then claim that the Qur'anic verses do not refer to earthquakes at all. They will claim that tameeda also means stagger, roll, sway, or tilt, and that there's significant difference between them and the short sharp shock of an earthquake (i.e. tameeda refers to some phenomenon, assumed to be associated with geological timescale, that is presently unknown to and undefined by our present understanding of geological science).

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_7">Analysis</span></h4>
<p>The relevant verses are as follows: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">He has created the heavens without supports that you can see, and has cast (alqa) onto the earth firm mountains (rawasiya) lest it should shake with you (tamida bikum **) ...<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Luqman 31:10</div></div>

<div class="quotes">And He has cast onto the earth firm mountains (rawasiya) lest it should shake with you… (tamida bikum**)<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Al-Nahl 16:15</div></div> 
<p>The phrase &quot;tamida bi&quot; from mada, yamidu, is only used in the above three Qur'anic verses which are marked **. Hans Wehr's &quot;Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic&quot; gives the meaning of the verbal phrase &quot;mada bi&quot; as: to shake something violently. &quot;Mada bi&quot; is the very form used in these verses. 
</p><p>It is clear that the term ‘tameeda’ is associated with people (i.e. less it should shake with <i>you</i>). Thus, tameeda cannot possibly refer to shaking in a geological timescale as people do not live in geological timescales. For this reason, tameeda and zalzala are synonyms, just as the English terms ‘seismic activity’ and ‘earth tremors’ are synonyms for earthquakes. 
</p><p>Even some Muslim commentators do not consider tameeda to mean shaking in geological timescale. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">(And We have placed on the earth firm mountains,) means, mountains which stabilize the earth and keep it steady and lend it weight, lest it should shake with the people, i.e., move and tremble so that they would not be able to stand firm on it -- because it is covered with water, apart from one-quarter of its surface.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=21&tid=32959?sid=21&tid=32959">In everything there is a Sign of Him, showing that He is One</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The claim that mountains are pegs is untrue as not all mountains have &quot;peg-like&quot; roots. And even the ones that can be claimed to have these peg-like roots, resemble pegs only with a lot of imagination. The claim that mountains stabilize the crust or the earth is (at best) unproven. There is no scientific evidence for this assertion, therefore the Qur'an cannot be validated by scientific evidence that does not exist. 
</p><p>The mere fact of isostacy is <i>not</i> proof that mountains stabilize the crust or the earth. The mere fact that collision-type mountains are formed at the edges of tectonic plates is <i>not</i> proof that mountains stabilize the plates. The mere fact that mountains have deep roots is <i>not</i> proof that mountains stabilize anything. 
</p><p>Lastly, is the Qur'an really the first scripture to make the assertion that Mountains stabilize the earth? Well, some Christians do not think so,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and the Bible predates the Qur'an by at least 400 years.
