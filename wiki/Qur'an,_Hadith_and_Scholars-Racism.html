<div class="quotes"><b>Arabs are the most noble people in lineage, the most prominent, and the best in deeds.</b> We were the first to respond to the call of the Prophet. We are Allah’s helpers and the viziers of His Messenger. We fight people until they believe in Allah. He who believes in Allah and His Messenger has protected his life and possessions from us. As for one who disbelieves, we will fight him forever in Allah’s Cause. Killing him is a small matter to us.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_IX:_The_Last_Years_of_the_Prophet" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 9, p. 69</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">&quot;A man married a maid-slave who bore him a child. Would that child be free or would he be an owned slave?&quot; &quot;Her child whom she bore from him would be the property of her master according to all the Imams (heads of the four Islamic schools of law) because the child follows the (status) of his mother in freedom or slavery. If the child is not of the race of Arabs, then he is definitely an owned slave according to the scholars, but the scholars disputed (his status) among themselves if he was from the Arabs - whether he must be enslaved or not because <b>when A'isha (Muhammad's wife) had a maid-slave who was an Arab, Muhammad said to A'isha, `Set this maid free because she is from the children of Ishmael.'</b>&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Timiyya, Vol. 31, pp. 376-377</div></div>
<div class="quotes"> Ali Ibn Abi Talib, said: Verily the Prophet said: God divided the earth in two halves and placed (me) in the better of the two, then He divided the half in three parts, and I was in the best of them, then <b>He chose the Arabs from among the people</b>, then He chose the Quraysh from among the Arabs, then He chose the children of ‘Abd al-Muttalib from among the Banu Hashim, then he chose me from among the children of ‘Abd al-Muttalib, and from them he chose me.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Racism.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sa'd, Vol. 1, p. 12</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>The fact that Allah Most High has chosen the Arabs over other nations is affirmed in rigorously authenticated hadiths of the Prophet</b>, may Allah bless him and give him peace; related by Bukhari and Muslim in their “Sahih” in the beginning of the chapter of merits, # 5897, on the authority of Wathilah ibn al-Asqa` who said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, ‘Verily Allah has chosen Kinanah from the son of Isma`il, and He has chosen Quraysh from among Kinanah and He has chosen Hashim from among Quraysh and He has chosen me from the Bani Hashim.’”
<p>So this hadith is a primary text about <b>the preference of Arabs over others and the preference of some Arabs over other Arabs</b>. And this is what the Imams have chosen from the………of their books, and even in individual books such as the book of Qurb about the merit of Arabs, authored by the great Imam al-Hafiz Zayn al-din al-`Iraqi. And it was summarized by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Hajar al-Haytami and others.
</p><p><b>Therefore the preference of Arabs over other nations, and the preference of some Arabs over other Arabs is affirmed in the Sacred Law.</b> Allah has even preferred some months over other months and some days and nights of over others, as well as places. So in the same way, Allah Glorious and Exalted is He, has chosen some men over others, such as the prophets over others and even some prophets over other prophets. Muslims should not have any objection to this, because all of this returns to the wisdom of the Most Wise, Glorious is He, who is not asked about what He does, but rather, they are the ones who are asked. So after a Muslim has believed in Allah as his Lord, the Truth, and that there is no God but Him, then he should know that this is from among His matters, Blessed and High is He, and there is nothing but magnificent wisdom in it that we might see or that we might not see. Either way, we are only responsible for submitting to His rule, Glorious is He. And among His rulings is that Arabs are preferred over others and that some Arabs are better than other Arabs, as the above hadith clearly explained. <b>So it is not appropriate for anyone to disagree in this when the proof is perfectly valid.</b>
</p><p>And there should be no disagreement in what has just preceded nor any disagreement in what appears in the Magnificent Book and in the sunna where we find that the real source of Allah’s preference is God-fearingness (taqwa) which result in the good deeds that people earn and that they are accounted for. So whoever sends forth good for himself, Allah has preferred him over those who have sent forth evil. As for the preference of an Arab over a non-Arab, and the preference of some Arabs over others, this is not a deed that one can earn. Rather, it is a bounty that Allah gives to whom He wills. So he may will something for these people, and there is no objection to your Lord’s rule. This is like the preference of some days over others, because the mind reasons that all days are the same in and of themselves, and there is no distinction that might appear between them. However, the mind can understand why something is better if there is not ……….. So the Sacred law came and affirmed the preference of some over others, and for some of those things there were reasons and wisdoms, such as the preference of the night of Power over others because the Majestic Qur’an was revealed during it. And in some of these things, the wisdom is not apparent to us and so this falls into the chapter of absolute obedience, such as the number of cycles (rak`ahs) in the prayer.
</p><p><b>It is obligatory on a Muslim to believe that Arabs are preferred over other nations because there is a proof for it.</b> However, this is not one of the pillars of our religion such that if someone rejected this, they would be considered outside of Islam. But if one does reject this, one has sinned for not believing in it because it is an affirmed matter according to a clear rigorously authenticated hadith. Also, this issue is not something that is commonly known among most Muslims, so for this, one should not hasten to blame one who disagrees with it. It is necessary, rather, to tell him about the issue.
</p><p>And the fact that Arabs are preferred over others does not mean that a non-Arab can not have a higher merit in the religion than an Arab, because a person earns the good deeds that Allah has recommended we compete for. This is the highest merit of God-fearingness and this will be the basis upon which things are decided in the hereafter. However, <b>the merit of the Arabs will still remain, in terms of their respect and exaltation being higher than others</b>. And from this some hadiths have come to us about the Quraysh being put first for the caliphate before others, such as the hadith in Bukhari (#3500) on the authority of Mu`awiyah, may Allah be well pleased with him who said, ” I heard the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, ‘This matter of government belongs to the Quraysh.

<div class="quotes">11. One of the most effective ways of finding comfort and contentment is to remember Allaah frequently
<p>Dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) has a wonderful effect in calming the soul and relieving stress and worry. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Verily, in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest.” [al-Ra’d 13:28]
</p><p>The greatest phrase of dhikr that can relieve the distress of death is: “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (there is no god except Allaah).” This is what Talhah told ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say a word which no slave says at the time of death but Allaah will ease his distress and brighten his colour. It was only the fear that I might not be able to do it that prevented me from asking him about it before he died.” ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I know what it is.” Talhah asked, “What is it?” ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Do you know any word greater that what he told his uncle to say? – ‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah’.” Talhah said, “That’s it, by Allaah, that’s it!”
</p><p>Allamah Majlisi and Allamah Samawi write on the authority of Sayyid Razi Daudi that when fighting started at Karbala on the l0th of Muharram in the year 61 A.H. Jaun came to. Imam Husayn and desired his permission to fight. Imam Husayn said, &quot;You have my permission. But O Jaun! You have stayed with me to live in peace and no wish to be killed!&quot; At these words Jaun fell at the feet of Imam Husayn and said, &quot;O my master, I am not one o those who flatter you during the period of peace and comfort, and leave you in times of adversity. O my master There is no doubt that my sweat gives a horrid smell, my lineage is not noble, and <b>my colour is black</b>, but with your blessing my sweat will become fragrant, my lineage will become noble and <b>my colour will get white</b> in Paradise. By Allah, I will not forsake you unless my blood mixes up with your blood&quot;. 
</p>
Muhammad bin Abi Talib Makki has written that when Jaun was martyred Imam Husayn came to his dead body, placed his head in his lap and prayed to Allah, &quot;O Allah! Brighten the face of Jaun, make his sweat fragrant and give him a place with the virtuous ones in .Heaven, so that he may stay with Muhammad and his Progeny (Ahlul Bayt)&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Racism.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> </div>
