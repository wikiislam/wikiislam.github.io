<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_and_Social_Conditions">Economic and Social Conditions</span></h2>
<p>When Muslims and non-Muslims belonging to the same society are faced with the same economic and social conditions, Muslim are sometimes (e.g. as in the following case) infinitely more likely to turn to terrorism than their non-Muslim counterparts.
</p>
<div class="quotes">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has thrown together a wide range of disparate groups... <b>All have used more or less the same</b> tactics, and all, with the exception of PFLP, use the same <b>Islamic rhetoric in order to describe the martyr and their mission</b>. <b>There is no commonality between the martyrs</b>, as rich, poor and middle class, young and old, men, women and children, educated and non-educated, have all participated in martyrdom operations... <b>Of the Palestinian society, only Christian Arabs thus far have not taken part in martyrdom operations</b>.  <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">March 2005</div></div>
<p>Terrorism goes across social and economic lines
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>The 400 terrorists on whom I’ve collected data</b> were the ones who actually targeted the “far enemy,” the U.S., as opposed to their own governments. I wanted to limit myself for analytical purity to that group, to see if I could identify anything different from other terrorist movements, which were far more nationalistic.<br><br>Most people think that terrorism comes from poverty, broken families, ignorance, immaturity, lack of family or occupational responsibilities, weak minds susceptible to brainwashing - the sociopath, the criminals, the religious fanatic, or, in this country, some believe they’re just plain evil.<br><br>Taking these perceived root causes in turn, <b>three quarters of my sample came from the upper or middle class.</b> The vast majority—<b>90 percent—came from caring, intact families. Sixty-three percent had gone to college,</b> as compared with the 5-6 percent that’s usual for the third world. <b>These are the best and brightest of their societies in many ways.</b><br><br>Al Qaeda’s members are not the Palestinian fourteen-year- olds we see on the news, but <b>join the jihad at the average age of 26.</b> <b>Three-quarters were professionals or semi- professionals. They are engineers, architects, and civil engineers, mostly scientists.</b> Very few humanities are represented, and quite surprisingly very few had any background in religion. The natural sciences predominate. Bin Laden himself is a civil engineer, Zawahiri is a physician, Mohammed Atta was, of course, an architect; and a few members are military, such as Mohammed Ibrahim Makawi, who is supposedly the head of the military committee.<br><br>Far from having no family or job responsibilities, <b>73 percent were married and the vast majority had children.</b> Those who were not married were usually too young to be married. Only 13 percent were madrassa-trained and most of them come from what I call the Southeast Asian sample, the Jemaah Islamiyya (JI). They had gone to schools headed by Sungkar and Bashir. Sungkar was the head of JI; he died in 1999. His successor, Bashir, is the cleric who is being tried for the Jakarta Marriott bombing of August 2003; he is also suspected of planning the October 2002 Bali bombing.<br><br>As a psychiatrist, originally I was looking for any characteristic common to these men. But <b>only four of the 400 men had any hint of a disorder. This is below the worldwide base rate for thought disorders. So they are as healthy as the general population. I didn’t find many personality disorders,</b> which makes sense in that people who are antisocial usually don’t cooperate well enough with others to join groups. This is a well-organized type of terrorism these men are not like Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, loners off planning in the woods. Loners are weeded out early on. <b>Of the nineteen 9-11 terrorists, none had a criminal record.</b> You could almost say that those least likely to cause harm individually are most likely to do so collectively.<br><br>At the time they joined jihad, the terrorists were not very religious. They only became religious once they joined the jihad. <b>Seventy percent of my sample joined the jihad while they were living in another country from where they grew up.</b><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">December 2004</div></div>
<p>According to a Rand Corporation report on counter-terrorism, prepared for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (US), terrorists are not particularly impoverished, uneducated, or afflicted by mental disease.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Terrorists are not particularly impoverished, uneducated, or afflicted by mental disease. Demographically, their most important characteristic is normalcy (within their environment). Terrorist leaders actually tend to come from relatively privileged backgrounds. These conclusions are firmly supported by empirical analysis<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">2009</div></div>
<p>2011 study finds no link between poverty and support for militant groups, and suggests poorer people are actually less likely to support extremist groups than the more affluent, better educated people.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Spending millions of pounds on development in Pakistan will do nothing to keep young men out of the clutches of the Taliban, according to an extensive survey of Pakistani attitudes towards extremism which will deepen the row over Britain's aid budget.
<p>The study [published by the Social Science Research Network], conducted by researchers from prestigious American universities, found <b>no link between poverty and support for militant groups</b>.
</p><p>The findings undermine a central pillar of the Conservative government's radical new policy on aid, which will deliver almost £1.4bn to Pakistan over the next five years as part of a strategy to protect Britain from terrorist attack.<br>. . .<br>
Christine Fair, a South Asia expert at Georgetown University and one of the authors of the new paper, said there was no evidence for such sweeping assertions and that her <b>study of 6,000 people suggested that poorer Pakistanis were actually less likely to support extremist groups than more affluent, better educated people</b>.
</p><p>&quot;The <b>terrorism literature has long held that poverty does not explain terrorism</b>,&quot; she told The Daily Telegraph. 
</p>
&quot;Yet despite what would be a fairly robust body of literature, both the British government and the American government, have put together this canard that we can buy our way out of terrorism by investing in education and so forth. We simply don't find this.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">May 2011</div></div>
<p>More than 45% of people convicted of Al Qaeda-associated terrorist offences in the UK have attended university/higher education institutions, or studied/achieved vocational or further education qualifications.
</p>
<div class="quotes">England's universities have become a breeding ground for extremism and terrorist recruitment, according to a disturbing [2011] government report. 
<p>Officials have identified 40 English universities where ‘there may be particular risk of radicalisation or recruitment on campus’. 
</p><p>A soon to be published Whitehall report – seen by the Daily Mail – will point to a string of examples of students going on to commit terrorist acts against this country or overseas.
</p><p>Alarmingly the Prevent review says that <b>‘more than 30 per cent of people convicted for Al Qaeda-associated terrorist offences in the UK... are known to have attended university or a higher education institution. </b>
</p><p><b>‘Another 15 per cent studied or achieved a vocational or further education qualification. About 10 per cent of the sample were students at the time when they were charged or the incident for which they were convicted took place.’</b><br>. . .<br>
The universities which have given places to fanatics include some of our most prestigious institutions.
</p><p>The report will say that terrorists who have attended English universities include Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, the Stockholm suicide bomber who had a BSc in sports therapy from the University of Luton, now the University of Bedfordshire.
</p><p>The alleged Detroit underpants bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, studied mechanical engineering at University College London between 2005 and 2008.
</p><p>Two of the fanatics convicted of the transatlantic liquid bomb plot – ringleader Abdulla Ahmed Ali and Assad Sarwar – attended City and Brunel Universities respectively.<br>. . .<br>
Ten of the 11 Pakistani nationals seized on suspicion of plotting an atrocity in the North-West in 2009 had student visas.

The alleged ringleader of this plot – Abid Naseer – was a computer studies student at Liverpool John Moores University.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2011</div></div>
<p>2/3 of UK terror suspects are from middle-class backgrounds, 1/2 are married (some have children), and 90% can be categorized as ‘sociable’ people with a high number of friends.
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Two-thirds of British terror  suspects are from middle-class backgrounds and those who become suicide bombers are often highly educated</b>, a classified MI5 document reveals. 
<p>The paper, marked ‘Secret: UK Eyes Only’, also debunks the myths that terrorists and suicide bombers are ‘loners’ and ‘psychopaths’.
</p><p>Instead, the security service says that <b>90 per cent of them can be  categorised as ‘sociable’ and have a high number of friends</b>.<br>. . .<br>
While the report says that Western foreign policy and the perception that ‘Islam is under siege’ plays a role, they are not the main cause. 
</p><p>Instead, the four causes of radicalisation are: 
</p><p>• ‘Trauma’, such as the death of a loved one: Ten per cent of terror suspects became radicalised after a life trauma, says the report.<br>• ‘Migration’: A third of all extremists ‘migrated to Britain alone’.<br>•  ‘Criminal activity’: Two-thirds of the sample had criminal records.<br>• ‘Prison’: Muslim prisoners who are not religious are often radicalised in prison. The report identified 60 known Islamist extremists operating in British jails. 
</p><p>The study says that <b>the ‘mean age’ at which a Muslim becomes radicalised is 21.6 years, while anyone between the ages of 16 and 32 is regarded as vulnerable</b>.
</p><p>The report added: ‘Where data is available, <b>two-thirds came from middle or upper-middle-class backgrounds, showing there is no simplistic relationship between poverty and involvement in Islamist extremism</b>.’
</p><p>The study also found that<b> half of the suspects it surveyed were married and some had children</b>. 
</p><p>‘This indicates that having commitments to a spouse and children did not necessarily restrain these individuals from becoming involved in activity that may have resulted in lengthy imprisonment, if not death.’
</p><p>The report adds: ‘<b>The vast majority (90 per cent of those on whom we have data) are described as sociable, with a number of friends. Our data thus tends to contradict commonly held stereotypes of terrorists being “mad”, psychopathic or evil</b>.
</p>
‘It also challenges the theory that individuals who turn to radical or extremist networks are those who are unable to make friends in normal life.’<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">October 2011</div></div>
<p>Compared with the world's Muslim population as a whole, Muslim terrorists are disproportionately from a higher education, higher income background.
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Most global jihadis are not illiterates raised in poor slums, but from well-off families and with advanced education degrees</b>.
<p>“Most of the danger comes from us,” said Majid Nawaz, founder of Khudi, at a seminar titled ‘Muslims and the Modern World  The State of the Muslim Ummah’. Young people being educated at “elite” schools and colleges were joining the extremists, he said.
</p>
“Terrorists are not just from slums – <b>statistically, a disproportionate number of global jihadis come from a higher education background</b>,” said Nawaz, who was formerly a member of the Hizbut Tahrir (HT). He quit the group to found Khudi, which works to counter extremism.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">May 2012</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Sunni Muslim terrorists committed “about 70 percent” of the 12,533 terrorist murders in the world last year, according to a report by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).
<p>The information comes from the 2011 <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.nctc.gov/docs/2011_NCTC_Annual_Report_Final.pdf&date=2012-08-04?url=http://www.nctc.gov/docs/2011_NCTC_Annual_Report_Final.pdf&date=2012-08-04">NCTC Report on Terrorism</a>, which is based on information available as of March 12, 2012.
</p><p><b>“Sunni extremists accounted for the greatest number of terrorist attacks and fatalities for the third consecutive year,” the report says. “More than 5,700 incidents were attributed to Sunni extremists, accounting for nearly 56 percent of all attacks and about 70 percent of all fatalities.”</b>
</p><p>The report says that in 2011, a total of 10,283 terrorism attacks across the world killed 12,533 people. Terrorism also is blamed for 25,903 injuries and 5,554 kidnappings.
</p><p><b>According to NCTC, of the 12,533 terrorism-related deaths worldwide, 8,886 were perpetrated by “Sunni extremists,” 1,926 by “secular/political/anarchist” groups, 1,519 by “unknown” factions, 170 by a category described as “other”, and 77 by “Neo-Nazi/Fascist/White Supremacist” groups.</b>
</p><p>CNSNews.com asked NCTC if it could break down the fatality and incident statistics by religious groups other than Sunni Muslims.
</p><p>Carl Kropf, a spokesman at NCTC, told CNSNews.com that the “only portrayal” NCTC has of terrorism perpetrators in 2011 is what is found in the report.
</p><p>“We don’t break it down any further than that,” he said. “I thought it was a pretty good treatment of how it is not just Sunni extremists, but there are other elements that conduct attacks, and those are captured as best we can.”
</p><p>The report showed that the number of terrorism-related fatalities “decreased by 5 percent” from 13,193 in 2010 to 12,533 in 2011, while the number of attacks dropped 12 percent from 11,641 in 2010 to 10,283 last year.
</p><p>“More than half [6,418] of the people killed in 2011 were civilians and 755 were children,” the report noted.
</p><p>Coming second after civilians were police: NCTC found that terrorism was responsible for the deaths of 2,423 law enforcement officers, followed by military security forces (1,389), and government representatives (768).
</p><p>“Muslims continued to bear the brunt of terrorism, while attacks targeting Christians dropped nearly 45 percent from a five-year high in 2010,” stated NCTC.
</p><p><b>“In cases where the religious affiliation of terrorism casualties could be determined, Muslims suffered between 82 and 97 percent of terrorism-related fatalities over the past five years,” added the report.</b>
</p><p><b>Countries with Muslim majorities such as Afghanistan “suffered the largest number of fatalities overall (in 2011) with 3,245 deaths, followed by Iraqis (2,958), Pakistanis (2,038), Somalis (1,013), and Nigerians (590).”</b>
</p><p>Al-Qaida (AQ) and its affiliates, considered to be Sunni extremists, were “responsible for at least 688 attacks that resulted in almost 2,000 deaths,” the report showed.
</p><p>The Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, also comprised of Sunni extremists, “conducted over 800 attacks that resulted in nearly 1,900 deaths,” NCTC said.
</p><p><b>According to the report, the second largest category of terrorism perpetrators in 2011 after Sunni extremists was “secular, political, and anarchist groups,” which were primarily identified as Marxist, communist sympathizers.</b>
</p><p><b>“Secular, political, and anarchist groups were the next largest category of perpetrators, conducting 2,283 attacks with 1,926 fatalities, a drop of 5 percent and 9 percent, respectively, from 2010,” stated NCTC.</b>
</p><p>The most active of the secular, political, and anarchist groups in 2011 included the FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC (377 attacks); the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) (351 attacks); the New People’s Army/Communist Party of the Philippines (NPA-CPP) (102 attacks); and the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) in Turkey (48 attacks). added the agency.
</p><p>The U.S. State Department’s 2011 Country Report on Terrorism describes FARC as a fighting “in support of Marxist goals” and being “heavily involved in narcotics production and trafficking.”
</p><p>The NCTC did not provide the exact number of deaths from FARC-related attacks. Most of the attacks and deaths related to terrorism that occurred across the world in 2011 involved armed conflict and bombings, according to the report.
</p><p>There were 5,895 terrorism-related armed attacks resulting in 4,290 deaths that year and 6,724 bombings causing 4,150 fatalities.
</p><p>Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) “were the most frequently used and the deadliest weapon employed,” the report said.
</p><p>The National Counterterrorism Center was created in 2004 to ensure, in part, that U.S. government agencies have appropriate access to and receive the intelligence necessary to accomplish their assigned missions.

And in Jordan, support for the Al Qaeda leader has risen over the last two years from 55% to a current 60%, including 25% who say they have a lot of confidence in him.

<p>The survey shows both hopeful and troubling signs with respect to Muslim support for terrorism and the viability of democracy in Muslim countries. In Jordan, Pakistan and Indonesia, there have been substantial declines in the percentages saying suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets can be justified to defend Islam against its enemies. The shift has been especially dramatic in Jordan, likely in response to the devastating terrorist attack in Amman last year; 29% of Jordanians view suicide attacks as often or sometimes justified, down from 57% in May 2005.
</p><p>Confidence in Osama bin Laden also has fallen in most Muslim countries in recent years. This is especially the case in Jordan, where just 24% express at least some confidence in bin Laden now, compared with 60% a year ago. A sizable number of Pakistanis (38%) continue to say they have at least some confidence in the al Qaeda leader to do the right thing regarding world affairs, but significantly fewer do so now than in May 2005 (51%). However, Nigeria's Muslims represent a conspicuous exception to this trend; 61% of Nigeria's Muslims say they have at least some confidence in bin Laden, up from 44% in 2003.
</p>
The belief that terrorism is justifiable in the defense of Islam, while less extensive than in previous surveys, still has a sizable number of adherents. Among Nigeria's Muslim population, for instance, nearly half (46%) feel that suicide bombings can be justified often or sometimes in the defense of Islam. Even among Europe's Muslim minorities, roughly one-in-seven in France, Spain, and Great Britain feel that suicide bombings against civilian targets can at least sometimes be justified to defend Islam against its enemies.<sup id="cite_ref-Pew_Survey:The_Great_Divide:_How_Westerners_and_Muslims_View_Each_Other_15-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-Pew_Survey:The_Great_Divide:_How_Westerners_and_Muslims_View_Each_Other-15">[15]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2006</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Who_Speaks_for_Islam.22">&quot;Who Speaks for Islam&quot;</span></h3>
<p>Dalia Mogahed and John Esposito co-authored the book &quot;Who Speaks for Islam&quot; which grew out of a survey conducted by the Gallup polling agency and released in 2008. The authors claim only 7 percent of the world's Muslims are &quot;political radicals&quot; who believe the 9/11 attacks were completely justified. Yet another 29.6 percent think the 9/11 attacks were partially or in some way justified. This takes the total world-wide percentage of Muslims who think the mass-slaughter of innocent non-Muslim (and some Muslim) civilians on 9/11 was either completely, partially or some way justified, up to 36.6 percent, or almost 4 out of every 10 Muslim.
</p>
<div class="quotes">In that article, she and Esposito wrote: &quot;Respondents who said 9/11 was justified (4 or 5 on the same scale) are classified as radical.&quot; In the book they wrote two years later, they redefined &quot;radical&quot; to comprise a much smaller group--only the Fives. But in her luncheon remarks, <b>Mogahed admitted that many of the &quot;moderates&quot; she and Esposito celebrated really aren't so moderate after all</b>.
<p><i>MOGAHED: I can't off the top of my head [recall the data], but we are going to be putting some of those findings in our [updated] book and our website.</i> 
</p><p><i>To clarify a couple of things about the book--the book is not a hard-covered polling report. The book is a book about the modern Muslim world that used its polling to inform its analysis. So that's important: It's meant for a general audience, and it's not meant to be a polling report. One very important reason why is because Gallup is selling subscriptions to its data. We are a for-profit company; we are not Pew. We are Gallup. So this isn't about .  .  . it was not meant for the data to be free since we paid $20 million to collect [the data] .  .  . that we paid all on our own. So just to clarify that  .  .  .  </i>
</p><p><i>So, how did we come up with the word &quot;politically radicalized&quot; that we unfortunately used in the book? Here's why: because people who were Fives, people who said 9/11 was justified, looked distinctly different from the Fours  .  .  .  At first, before we had enough data to do sort of a cluster analysis, we lumped the Fours and Fives together because that was our best judgment.</i>
</p><p><i>QUESTIONER: And what percent was that?</i>
</p><p><i>MOGAHED: I seriously don't remember but I think it was in the range of 7 to 8 percent [actually, 6.5 percent].</i>
</p><p><i>QUESTIONER: So it's seven Fours and seven Fives?</i>
</p><p><i>MOGAHED: Yes, we lumped these two and did our analysis. When we had enough data to really see when things broke away, here's what we found: Fives looked very different from the Fours, and Ones through Fours looked similar. [Mogahed then explained that, on another question, concerning suicide bombing, respondents who said 9/11 was only partially justified clustered with those who said it wasn't justified at all.] And so the Fives looked very different; they broke, they clustered away, and Ones through Fours clustered together. And that is how we decided to break them apart and decided how we were to define &quot;politically radicalized&quot; for our research.</i> 
</p><p><i><b>Yes, we can say that a Four is not that moderate</b> .  .  . I don't know. .  .  .You are writing a book, you are trying to come up with terminology people can understand. .  .  . You know, maybe it wasn't the most technically accurate way of doing this, but this is how we made our cluster-based analysis.</i>
</p><p>So, there it is--the smoking gun. Mogahed publicly admitted they knew certain people weren't moderates but they still termed them so. She and Esposito cooked the books and dumbed down the text. Apparently, by the authors' own test, there are not 91 million radicals in Muslim societies but almost twice that number. <b>They must have shrieked in horror to find their original estimate on the high side of assessments made by scholars, such as Daniel Pipes, whom Esposito routinely denounces as Islamophobes</b>. To paraphrase Mogahed, maybe it wasn't the most technically accurate way of doing this, but their neat solution seems to have been <b>to redefine 78 million people off the rolls of radicals</b>. 
</p><p>The cover-up is even worse. The full data from the 9/11 question show that, in addition to the 13.5 percent, there is another 23.1 percent of respondents--<b>300 million Muslims--who told pollsters the attacks were in some way justified</b>. Esposito and Mogahed don't utter a word about the vast sea of intolerance in which the radicals operate.
</p>
And then there is the more fundamental fraud of using the 9/11 question as the measure of &quot;who is a radical.&quot; <b>Amazing as it sounds, according to Esposito and Mogahed, the proper term for a Muslim who hates America, wants to impose Sharia law, supports suicide bombing, and opposes equal rights for women but does not &quot;completely&quot; justify 9/11 is . . . &quot;moderate.&quot;</b><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">May 2008</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Ten years down the road since the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent war on terror launched by the United States, Pakistan seems to have been turned into the suicide bombing capital of the world, with the country’s security forces, especially the army and the police, often being targeted by lethal human bombs. 
<p><b>In 303 suicide attacks carried out in almost every nook and corner of Pakistan 4,808 people were killed and 10,149 others injured in the decade to September 11, 2011, according to Ministry of Interior data.</b> 
</p><p>Statistically speaking, that staggering death toll means that on average, suicide bombers have killed 480 people and injured 1,014 others every year across Pakistan since September 11, 2011 - though, post-9/11, the phenomenon first struck in 2002. Likewise, Pakistan has suffered <b>an average 30 suicide bombings every year</b> of the decade, or four attacks a month.<br>. . .<br>
Suicide bombers actually came to Pakistan in force in 2002. The first attack of its kind occurred on March 16 that year, when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a church in Islamabad, killing five people and injuring 40 others. 
</p><p>Fifteen people died and 35 others were injured on May 8 that year when a bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a bus near the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi. Those killed in the attack included nine French engineers and five Pakistanis technicians who were working on a naval project. The attacks placed Pakistan on the world map of countries marred by suicide bombings.<br>. . .<br>
The next year, in 2003, a total of 70 people were killed and 114 injured in three suicide attacks, two targeting the president, General Pervez Musharraf in December and one targeting former prime minister Shaukat Aziz in June. 
</p><p>In 2004, 91 people were killed and 393 injured in seven incidents. The death doll in 2005 was 86 people killed and 219 injured in four strikes, while 161 people were killed and 352 injured in seven attacks in 2006. 
</p><p>The following year saw an unprecedented rise in suicide attacks, in the wake of the army's gory Operation Silence against fanatical Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) clerics and their followers in the heart of Islamabad. A record number of 766 people were killed and 1,677 injured in 56 attacks in 2007. 
</p><p>The perilous trend of suicide strikes targeting the Pakistani security forces touched alarming heights that year, averaging more than one hit a week as the military establishment lost control of extremist jihadi networks and the leaders it had nurtured to advance its agenda in Afghanistan and India.<br>. . .<br>
The number of suicide bombings multiplied further next year - in 2008 - killing 895 people and injuring 1873 in 60 such incidents. There were 78 suicide attacks in 2009, killing 951 people and wounding 2,361. The ugly phenomenon peaked in 2010, when 1,172 people were killed and 2,204 injured in 51 such incidents. 
</p><p>It seems to be on the decline, with 601 people killed and 842 others injured in 36 incidents this year to the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, compared to the lives of 857 Pakistanis lost in who had lost their lives in 41 incidents between January 1, 2010 and September 11, 2010. 
</p><p>In a grim monthly break-down of the suicide bomb statistics for 2011, 45 people were killed in four incidents, 39 people were killed in three suicide attacks in February, 127 more lost their lives in six suicide attacks in March; another 65 were killed in April, 154 people lost their lives at the hands of human bombs in five such incidents in May, 66 more Pakistanis perished in four attacks in June, 11 people were killed in three attacks in July, and 71 Pakistanis lost their lives in four suicide bombings in August.

Some 61 per cent wanted Islamic courts - operating on sharia principles – &quot;so long as the penalties did not contravene British law&quot;. A major part of civil cases in this country deal with family disputes such as divorce, custody and inheritance.
The poll also found a high level of religious observance with just over half saying they pray five times a day, every day - although women are shown to be more devout than men.

</p><p>Seven of the UK’s eight major bomb plot cells contained individual members with direct links to al Qaida - only the failed London bombers of July 21 2005 lacked undisputed evidence of direct contact with any proscribed organisation. 
</p><p>Just under a third (31%) of all individuals who committed IROs attended one or more terrorist training camps, the most common location being Pakistan. Seven of the eight major bomb plot cells contained members who attended terrorist training camps. 
</p><p>More than two-thirds (68%) of IROs were committed by those aged below 30.

</p><p>&quot;Providing policymakers this data can allow for a factual discussion and diminish rhetoric,&quot; Neuhaus Schaan said. &quot;Consequently, policy can be crafted to address current and future needs in the face of change and adaptation by those determined to bring harm to the United States.&quot;
</p><p>Other key findings from the report include:
</p>
<dl><dd>• Of the 104 people arrested for Islamic extremist activities between January 2009 and April 2011, half were born in the U.S., 22 percent were naturalized citizens and 7 percent were dual citizens. </dd>
<dd>• Of the 104, 5 percent entered the U.S. on a visa. </dd>
<dd>• Sixty-three percent of converts had a known prior criminal record. </dd>
<dd>• Of the 14 American converts with a prior criminal history, at least 55 percent had converted to Islam in prison. </dd>
<dd>• Ninety-two 92 percent were male. </dd>
<dd>• Sixty-four percent were 30 years old or younger. </dd>
<dd>• Sixty-six percent had traveled or were in the process of traveling to the Middle East, Somalia, South Asia or the Balkans. </dd>
<dd>• Of the 104, 70 percent had an association or were attempting an association with an internationally recognized terrorist organization; al-Qaida and its associated branches were cited most. </dd>
<dd>• Of the 29 persons with no known association to a group, 11 had been active on terrorist-related chat rooms and websites. </dd>
<dd>• Overall, 38 percent had been involved in this Internet activity. </dd>
<dd>• Only 10 of the 104 are what the authors would consider &quot;lone wolves&quot;; most in the cohort had ties to others in the group or to an organization. </dd></dl>
<p>Information on birthplaces and conversion to Islam was available for 77 of the 104 people arrested. The data revealed that 60 percent of the group was born outside the U.S. Of the 31 U.S.-born persons where religion of origin could be determined , 14 were born into Muslim families and 17 converted to Islam. 
</p><p>&quot;The Internet and prison conversion are the two biggest new trends that policymakers need to look at more closely,&quot; Neuhaus Schaan said. &quot;We've seen a major change in how people become associated with extremist groups in the past 20 years, and we need to adapt.&quot;
</p>
The report concludes that approximately two-thirds of those involved in extremist activity are men under the age of 34, and no single, all-encompassing profile can be made of the analysis group of 104. Neuhaus Schaan said that the Baker Institute will continue to compile data and issue an updated report annually.<sup id="cite_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">November 2011</div></div>

<div class="quotes">National security officials on Monday reported that the number of “confirmed” cases in which former detainees previously held at the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity after their transfer had <b>risen to 95 from 81 – out of the 599 prisoners released</b> – from October 2010 to December 2011.<br>. . .<br>
Of the 95 currently listed as “confirmed” as having engaged in terrorist activity after their transfer, 12 are dead and 28 are back in some country’s custody, while 55 are not in custody, the report said. Of the 72 “suspected” former detainees, 2 are dead, 26 are in custody, and 44 are not in custody.<sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">March 2012</div></div>
<div class="quotes">A recent report by the House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security states that <b>there are hundreds, perhaps even thousands, people he described as &quot;Iranian and Hezbollah terrorists&quot; in the United States</b>.<br>. . .<br>
<p>A law enforcement official said that the New York Police Department, whose monitoring of Muslim communities has prompted political controversy, believes that <b>between 200 and 300 Hezbollah sympathizers live in New York City.

</p>
A preliminary Homeland Security report said that pinpointing the number of Hezbollah operatives inside the United States was difficult because of the group's operational security. The report nonetheless cited the estimates of &quot;some officials&quot; that the group <b>&quot;likely&quot; has &quot;several thousand sympathetic donors&quot; in the United States as well as &quot;hundreds&quot; of operatives</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Terrorism.html#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">April 2012</div></div>

Bjelopera, “American Jihadist Terrorism: Combating a Complex Threat,” Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, updated November 15, 2011, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R41416.pdf">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/terror/R41416.pdf</a> (accessed September 17, 2012). All plots discussed in this report, however, involved targets in the United States. For more information on international terrorist plots, see David Muhlhausen and Jena Baker McNeill, “Terror Trends: 40 Years’ Data on International and Domestic Terrorism,” Heritage Foundation Special Report No. 93, May 20, 2011, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/05/terror-trends-40-years-data-on-international-and-domestic-terrorism">http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/05/terror-trends-40-years-data-on-international-and-domestic-terrorism</a>.
