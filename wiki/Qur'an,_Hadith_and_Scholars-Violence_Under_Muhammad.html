<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abu_Dawud">Abu Dawud</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">... He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with the Apostle of Allah? He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath of allegiance to him for Islam...<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/020-sat.php#020.3188#020.3188">20:3188</a> </div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ibn_Ishaq">Ibn Ishaq</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Hamzah came with his bow slung over his shoulder. He was a great hunter, the strongest man of the Quraysh. A woman rose up and said, ‘If only you had seen what your nephew Muhammad had to endure just now before you came. Abu Jahl spoke to him offensively. Hamzah was carried away by a fury, as it was Allah's will to honor him this way. He went off quickly, not stopping to speak to anyone. Instead of circumambulating the Ka'aba, he was ready to attack Abu Jahl when he saw him. When he entered the mosque, he saw him sitting among the people. Hamzah raised his bow and gave Abu Jahl a blow which split his head open in an ugly way. He said, ‘Do you insult him when I am a member of his religion? Hit me back if you can.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:131</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Umar became a Muslim, he being a strong, stubborn man whose protégés none dare attack. The prophet's companions were so fortified by him and Hamza that they got the upper hand on the Quraysh. ‘We could not pray at the Ka'aba until Umar became a Muslim, and then he fought the Quraysh until we could pray there.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:155</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Uhud commanded the Apostles archers. He was killed in the battle of Yemen as a martyr. Abu was present at all of the Apostle's battles and died in Byzantine territory as a martyr. Mu'adh was present at every raid. He was killed at Badr as a martyr. Mu'awwidh, his brother, shared the same glory. Umara was at every battle and died a martyr in Yemen. As'ad died before Badr when the Prophet's mosque was being built. The Apostle put Amr in command of the rearguard. He died at Uhud as a martyr. Abdallah led many raids and was slain as a martyr at Muta. He was one of Muhammad's commanders. Khallad fought at Badr, Uhud, and Khandaq. He was martyred fighting the [Jewish] Qurayza. The Apostle said that he would have the reward of two martyrs.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:208</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Apostle prepared for war in pursuance of Allah’s command to fight his enemies and to fight the infidels who Allah commanded him to fight.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:280</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Quraysh said, ‘Muhammad and his Companions have violated the sacred month, shed blood, seized property, and taken men captive. Muhammad claims that he is following obedience to Allah, yet he is the first to violate the holy month and to kill.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:288</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Our lances drank of Amr's blood and lit the flame of war.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:289</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I am fighting in Allah’s service. This is piety and a good deed. In Allah’s war I do not fear as others should. For this fighting is righteous, true, and good.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:300</div></div>
<div class="quotes">When the Allah's Apostle said, ‘70,000 of my followers shall enter Paradise like the full moon,' Ukkasha asked if he could be one of them. Then a lesser Ansari asked to be included, but the Prophet replied, ‘Ukkasha beat you to it and my prayer is now cold.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:306</div></div>
<div class="quotes">When the Apostle was in Safra, Nadr was assassinated. When Muhammad reached Irq al-Zabyah he killed Uqbah. When the Prophet ordered him to be killed, Uqbah said, ‘Who will look after my children, Muhammad?' &quot;Hellfire,' the Apostle replied, and he was killed.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:308, See Also <a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_VII:_The_Foundation_of_the_Community" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 7, p. 65</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">In peace you are wild asses—rough and coarse. And in war you are like women wearing corsets. But I care not so long as my hand can grasp my trusty blade.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:316</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Allah said, ‘Do not turn away from Muhammad when he is speaking to you. Do not contradict his orders. And do not be a hypocrite, one who pretends to be obedient to him and then disobeys him. Those who do so will receive My vengeance. You must respond to the Apostle when he summons you to war.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:322</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I will cast terror into the hearts of those who reject Me. So strike off their heads and cut off their fingers. All who oppose Me and My Prophet shall be punished severely.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:322</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Muslims, fight in Allah’s Cause. Stand firm and you will prosper. Help the Prophet, obey him, give him your allegiance, and your religion will be victorious.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:325</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Prophet exhort the believers to fight. If there are twenty good fighters they will defeat two hundred for they are a senseless people. They do not fight with good intentions nor for truth.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:326</div></div>
<div class="quotes">If they ask you for peace on the basis of Islam (submission), make peace on that basis. Be of one mind by His religion.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:326</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Ka'b's body was left prostrate [humbled in submission]. After his fall, all of the Nadir Jews were brought low. Sword in hand we cut him down. By Muhammad's order we were sent secretly by night. Brother killing brother. We lured him to his death with guile [cunning or deviousness]. Traveling by night, bold as lions, we went into his home. We made him taste death with our deadly swords. We sought victory for the religion of the Prophet.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:368</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Thereupon Mas'ud leapt upon Sunayna, one of the Jewish merchants with whom his family had social and commercial relations and killed him. The Muslim's brother complained, saying, ‘Why did you kill him? You have much fat in you belly from his charity.' Mas'ud answered, ‘By Allah, had Muhammad ordered me to murder you, my brother, I would have cut off your head.' Wherein the brother said, ‘Any religion that can bring you to this is indeed wonderful!' And he accepted Islam.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:369</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Apostle, wearing two coats of mail, drew up his troops for battle, about 700 men. There were 50 archers. Muhammad said, ‘Keep their cavalry away with your arrows.' Then he asked, ‘Who will take my sword with its right and use it as it deserves to be used?' Abu Dujana asked, ‘What is its right, Apostle?' ‘That you should smite the enemy with it until it bends.' When Dujana took the sword from the Apostle's hand he walked toward the fight reciting: ‘I'm the man who took the sword when &quot;Use it right&quot; was the Prophet's word for the sake of Allah.' When Muhammad saw Dujana strutting, he said, ‘This is a gait which Allah hates except on an occasion like this.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:373</div></div>
<div class="quotes">‘Come here you son of a female circumciser.' His mother was Umm Anmar, a female circumciser in Mecca. Hamza smote and killed him.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:375</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Abu Dujana said, ‘I saw a person inciting the enemy, shouting violently. When I made for him, I lifted my sword and he shrieked, and lo, it was a woman. I respected the Prophet's sword too much to use it on a girl.'&quot; Ishaq:380 &quot;We attacked them thrusting, slaying, chastising, and driving them before us with blows on every side. Had not women seized their war banner they would have been sold in the markets like chattel.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:375</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Then Allah sent down His help to the Muslims and fulfilled His promise. They slew the enemy with the sword until they cut them off from their camp and there was a rout.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:379</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Muslims were put to the fight and the Meccans slew many of them. It was a day of trial and testing in which Allah honored several with martyrdom.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:380</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Perhaps Allah will grant us martyrdom.' So they took their swords and sallied out until they mingled with the [retreating] army. One was killed by the Meccans, the other by his fellow Muslims who failed to recognize him. One of the young men's fathers confronted Muhammad and said, ‘You have robbed my son of his life by your deception and brought great sorrow to me.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:383</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Hind [a Meccan woman who had lost her father, husband, son, and brother to Muhammad's raiders at Badr] stopped to mutilate the Muslim dead, cutting off their ears and noses until she was able to make anklets and necklaces of them. Then she ripped open Hamzah's body for his liver and chewed it. Then she climbed a high rock and screamed rajaz poetry at the top of her voice, taunting us. ‘We have paid you back for Badr. A war that follows a war is always violent. I could not bear the loss of Utba nor my brother, his uncle, or my first-born son. I have slaked my vengeance and fulfilled my vow.' Umar [the future leader of the Islamic world] recited these verses back to her: ‘The vile woman was insolent, and she was habitually base with disbelief. May Allah curse Hind, she with the large clitoris. …Her backside and her genitals are covered with ulcers as a result of spending too much time in the saddle. Did you set out seeking to avenge our killing of your father and your son at Badr? And for your husband, who was wounded in the backside, lying in his blood, and your brother, all of them coated in the grime of the pit. What a foul deed you committed. Woe to you Hind, the shame of the age.'<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:385</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Amr Jamuh was a very lame man. He had four lion-like sons who were present at the Apostle’s battles. At Uhud he came to the Prophet and told him that his sons wanted to keep him back and prevent his joining the army. ‘Yet, by Allah, I hope to tread in the Heavenly Garden of Paradise despite my lameness. The Apostle said, ‘Allah has excused you, and Jihad is not incumbent on you.’ Then Muhammad turned to his sons and said, ‘You need not prevent him.

We are Allah’s helpers and the viziers of His Messenger. We fight people until they believe in Allah. He who believes in Allah and His Messenger has protected his life and possessions from us. As for one who disbelieves, we will fight him forever in the Cause of Allah. <b>Killing him is a small matter to us.</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_IX:_The_Last_Years_of_the_Prophet" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 9, p. 69</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">The Messenger sent Khalid with an army of 400 to Harith [a South Arabian tribe] and ordered him to invite them to Islam for three days before he fought them.

<div class="quotes">Abdallah Azdi came to the Messenger, embraced Islam, and became a good Muslim.
