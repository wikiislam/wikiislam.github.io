<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an has stipulated a waiting period which women must observe before they can remarry. This waiting period must be observed after they are divorced, or if their husbands have died. In the Qur'an, this is called <i>Iddah</i> or <i>Iddat</i> (العدة‎). However, there is one exception to this requirement in Qur'an 33:49:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> <div align="right">
<p>ياايها الذين امنوا اذا نكحتم المؤمنات ثم طلقتموهن من قبل ان تمسوهن فمالكم عليهن من عدة تعتدونهافمتعوهن وسرحوهن سراحا جميلا
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Transliteration:</b> <i>Ya ayyuha allatheena amanoo itha nakahtumu almuminati thumma tallaqtumoohunna min qabli an tamassoohunna fama lakum AAalayhinna min AAiddatin taAAtaddoonaha famattiAAoohunna wasarrihoohunna sarahan jameelan</i>
</p>
<b>Yusuf Ali:</b> O ye who believe! If ye wed believing women and divorce them before ye have touched them, then there is no period that ye should reckon. But content them and release them handsomely.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/33/49/default.htm">Qur'an Text/Transliteration 33:49</a></div></div>
<p>From the verse above it is understood that Iddah (stipulated waiting period) is required if sexual contact has occurred within the marriage. If a woman is not touched by her husband, she should not have to observe any waiting period at all.
</p><p>After the mention of women who have not had their marriage consummated, the Qur'an goes further - discussing the women who need to observe the 'iddah, and the span of time required. We see in Qur'an 65.4: 
</p>
<div class="quotes"><div align="right">
<p>واللائي يئسن من المحيض من نسائكم ان ارتبتم فعدتهن ثلاثة اشهر واللائي لم يحضن واولات الاحمال اجلهن ان يضعن حملهن ومن يتق الله يجعل له من امره يسرا
</p>
</div>	
<p><b>Transliteration:</b> <i>Waalla-ee ya-isna mina almaheedi min nisa-ikum ini irtabtum faAAiddatuhunna thalathatu ashhurin waalla-ee lam yahidna waolatu al-ahmali ajaluhunna an yadaAAna hamlahunna waman yattaqi Allaha yajAAal lahu min amrihi yusran</i>
</p>
<b>Yusuf Ali:</b> Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the prescribed period, if ye have any doubts, is three months, and for those who have no courses (it is the same): for those who carry (life within their wombs), their period is until they deliver their burdens: and for those who fear Allah, He will make their path easy.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/65/4/default.htm">Qur'an Text/Transliteration 65:4</a></div></div>
<p>Here the 'Iddah is prescribed to three categories of women:
</p>
<ol><li>First the phrase: “Yaisna min al-maheedhi” which means “those women who are desperate of menses” is an indication to women who reached the stage of menstruation but do not menstruate and of those who reached menopause. Desperate of menses underlines that it concerns women who though reached the age, fail to menstruate too. Their 'Iddah period is three months. </li>
<li>Next comes, “Wallaee Lam yahidhna” which means “those who have not menstruated yet” This group of females are pre-pubescent girls who have not yet menstruated. Here the 'Iddah prescribed for them is equal to the previous group of women (ie. three months). </li>
<li>Lastly, the women who are pregnant - their prescribed 'iddah is until they have given birth.</li></ol>
<p>The above translation of the verse masks the real meaning, so the verse has to be studied in <a href="wiki/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a>. The actual meaning of this verse and its implications are explicitly endorsed by <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsirs</a> as will be shown below.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_of_Verse_in_Arabic">Analysis of Verse in Arabic</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an says in Arabic:
</p>
<div class="quotes"><div align="right">
<p>واللائي لم يحضن&quot; فعدتهن ثلاثة أشهر 
</p>
</div>
&quot;and those who never had menses&quot; (because they are underage)<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://quran.al-islam.com/Tafseer/DispTafsser.asp?l=arb&taf=GALALEEN&nType=1&nSora=65&nAya=4?l=arb&taf=GALALEEN&nType=1&nSora=65&nAya=4">Quran 65:4</a><br>Tafsir from al-Islam.com</div></div> 
<p>The transliteration of the verse and the meaning of each portion of the verse is given below:
</p><p><i>Wa Al-Lā'ī Lam Yaĥiđna</i> 
</p><p><i>wa</i> ( <font size="4">وَ</font> ) = and
</p><p><i>Al-Lā'ī</i> ( <font size="4">وَاللَّائِي</font> ) = for those who
</p><p><i>Lam</i> ( <font size="4">لَمْ </font>) = did not (negation in past tense) <sup id="cite_ref-EB_2-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-EB-2">[2]</a></sup> 
</p><p><i>Yaĥiđna</i> ( <font size="4">يَحِضْنَ</font> ) = menstruate. 
</p><p><i>Yaĥiđna</i> comes from the verbal root H-Y-D ( <font size="4">حيض</font> ) which means &quot;to menstruate&quot;. 
</p><p>The addition of prefix &quot;Ya&quot; and suffix &quot;na&quot; to the root &quot;HYD&quot; shows that the word is used in used in third person, feminine gender, plural, imperfective aspect.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>The imperfective aspect, by itself lacks any tense feature. <sup id="cite_ref-EB_2-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-EB-2">[2]</a></sup> The tensed negatives like <i>lam</i> ( <font size="3">لَمْ </font> ) (negation in past tense), <i>lan</i> ( <font size="3">لن</font> )  (negation in future tense), <i>laa</i> ( <font size="3">لَ</font> ) (negation in present tense) combined with imperfectives decide the tense in this case. 
</p><p>Thus <i>lam Yadrus</i> = He did not study. 
</p><p>In the verse 65:4, <b><i>Lam Yaĥiđna</i> = 'those who did not menstruate'.</b> 
</p><p>Further the imperfective verb in the context of <i>lam</i> ( <font size="3">لَمْ </font> ) (past tensed negatives) is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood#Jussive#Jussive" class="extiw" title="w:Grammatical mood">Jussive</a> mood. <sup id="cite_ref-EB_2-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-EB-2">[2]</a></sup> 
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>The mood is similar to the cohortative mood, in that it expresses plea, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement, wish, desire, intent, command, purpose or consequence.</b> In some languages, the two are distinguished in that cohortative occurs in the first person and the jussive in the second or third. It is found in Arabic, where it is called the مجزوم, majzum. The rules governing the jussive in Arabic are somewhat complex. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> </div> 
<p>Supporting these meanings, from Lane's lexicon, <i>Lam</i> (<font size="4">ل</font>) means 'not':
</p>
<div class="quotes">Lam = ل
<br>lam = Negative particle giving to the present the sense of the perfect; not.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Lane's Lexicon for <i>Lam</i></div></div>
<p>From the Lexicon, Arabic word for Menstruate is 'Haiz' (<font size="4">حيض</font>):

<p>Conclusion:
</p>
<ul><li> It is clear the verse 65:4 is given as a command to be followed (Jussive mood). </li>
<li> The verse itself refers to those women who did not menstruate(in all of past time until the present time), which can include children or girls before puberty or attainment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/menarche" class="extiw" title="w:menarche">menarche</a> (first period).</li></ul>
<p>Therefore, the exact translation of this portion of <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/065-qmt.php#065.004#065.004">65:4</a> is <i>&quot;Not menstruated yet&quot;</i> ( <font size="4">لَمْ يَحِضْنَ</font> ). In Arabic, the menstruating process is called HAIDH ( <font size="4">حيض</font> ). It is possible to turn this noun into its verb form. Like we do it with menstruation, &quot;menstruate&quot; is YAHIDH ( <font size="4">يَحِض</font> ). But it is LAM ( <font size="4">لَمْ  </font> ) that appears before YAHIDH and the NA ( <font size="4">نَ</font> ) associated with YAHIDH and this puts Islamic apologists in a quandary because it cannot have any other meaning than <i>“Not menstruated yet”</i>. This is the appropriate English translation.
</p><p>This verse 65:4 should be read as a continuation of Qur'an 33:49. If a woman who has not been used for sex should not have to observe any Iddah at all, as mentioned in 33:49, what is the reason for the prescribed Iddah for those women who have not yet menstruated? This is a clear indication marrying pre-pubescent girls and having sex with them is sanctioned by the Qur'an.
</p><p>The phrase found in Qur'an 65:4 as &quot;Wallaee Lam Yahidhna&quot; is sometimes mistranslated by <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a>. Exact meaning of the phrase is available in Tafsirs (Quran interpretations).

<div class="quotes">Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Quran the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, <b>making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permissible for the husband to consummate marriage with her.</b> Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Quran has held as permissible.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65?sura=65">Commentary on Qur'an Chapter 65:4</a><br>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, Tafhim al-Qur'an</div></div>
<p>Note here what Maududi mentions on giving pre-pubescent girls in marriage and consummating the marriage with them. The interpreter affirms it is permitted by the Qur'an and no Muslims can question or forbid it.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shaykh_Muhammad_ibn_.E2.80.98Uthaymeen">Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Surah al-Talaaq 65:4: 
If a woman does not menstruate, either because she is very young or old and past menopause, then her ‘iddah is three months, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses (i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Majmoo’at As’ilah tahumm al-Usrah al-Muslimah, p. 61-63</div></div>
<p>The reason for bringing two more recent scholars is to show that <i>nothing has changed</i> in the Islamic tenets on marrying and having sex with pre-pubescent girls, even in this modern era.

<div class="quotes">The Noble Qur'an has also mentioned the waiting period [i.e. for a divorced wife to remarry] for the wife who has not yet menstruated, saying: &quot;And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women - if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated&quot; [Qur'an 65:4]. Since this is not negated later, <b>we can take from this verse that it is permissible to have sexual intercourse with a prepubescent girl</b>. The Qur'an is not like the books of jurisprudence which mention what the implications of things are, even if they are prohibited. <b>It is true that the prophet (PBUH) entered into a marriage contract with A'isha when she was six years old, however he did not have sex with her until she was nine years old</b>, according to al-Bukhari.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http:%2F%2Fwww.islamonline.net%2Far%2FIOLCounsel_C%2F1278406761316%2F1278406720653%2F%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%9F-&date=2011-02-03?url=http:%2F%2Fwww.islamonline.net%2Far%2FIOLCounsel_C%2F1278406761316%2F1278406720653%2F%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%9F-&date=2011-02-03">Is it permissible to restrict the age at which girls can marry?</a><br>Submitted by Ahmad, IslamOnline, December 24, 2010</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>Getting married at an early age is something that is confirmed by the book of Allah</b>, the Sunnah of his Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam), the consensus of the scholars and the actions of the companions, and the Muslims who came after them. 
<p>Moreover, the interest of Shariah proves it. So the claim that this was abrogated is not correct. And the Hadith did not include that meaning; it just states that a virgin woman is not to be married until consulted. 
</p><p>The evidence from the Qur'an is: 
</p><p>1. The saying of Allah: &quot;And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the 'Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubts (about their periods), is three months, and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their 'Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise, except in case of death]&quot;. (At-Talaq 65:4)
</p><p>So, <b>Allah set rulings of marriage, divorce and waiting period for the women who have not yet had menses, i.e. the young girls</b>.
</p>
The Iddah (waiting period) does not take place except after marriage.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/61C5nBLpe">Child marriage in Islam</a><br>Islamweb, Fatwa No. 88089, June 24, 2004</div></div>

<p>Modern apologists who reject the tafsirs and the ahadith often wish to present Qur'an 65:4 as having been 'mistranslated' or 'misunderstood' throughout the ages by all of their own Islamic scholars. Instead they wish to re-translate 65:4 in a less harmful way, and then point to other verses in the Qur'an in an attempt to show that Allah did not allow Muslim men to marry pre-pubescent females. The favourite verse for this is usually Qur'an 4:6:

If the guardian is well-off, Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable.

And when ye deliver up their fortune unto orphans, have (the transaction) witnessed in their presence. Allah sufficeth as a Reckoner.
</p>
<b>Shakir:</b> And test the orphans until they attain puberty; then if you find in them maturity of intellect, make over to them their property, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily, lest they attain to full age; and whoever is rich, let him abstain altogether, and whoever is poor, let him eat reasonably; then when you make over to them their property, call witnesses in their presence; and Allah is enough as a Reckoner.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/4/6/default.htm">Qur'an Text/Transliteration 4:6</a></div></div>
<p>Both Yusuf Ali and Pickthal render the phrase of &quot;marriageable age&quot;/&quot;age of marriage&quot;, whereas Shakir says &quot;attain puberty&quot;, the actual word used is <a href="wiki/Nikah.html" title="Nikah" class="mw-redirect">Nikah</a> which literally translated means &quot;fuck&quot; <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> . <i>Zuwaj</i> <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> is the correct word for marriage in Arabic, but the Qur'an uses both words in reference to marrying women; Nikah for human females and Zuwaj for the Houris. This means that Shakir's translation of &quot;attain puberty&quot; is not correct, as the actual word being translated is used regarding marriage and has nothing to do with puberty.
</p><p>Furthermore, this verse is not even discussing marriage; it's talking about those who have guardianship over <i>male</i> orphans; that when they judge them to be mentally mature enough, they should give over their property to them. The verse simply says that you can start testing them for this maturity when they reach &quot;marriageable age&quot; - it does not specify that age. The Tafsir's agree with this understanding of 4:6:

<div class="quotes"><b>Giving Back the Property of the Orphans When They Reach Adulthood</b>
<p>Allah said,
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>[وَابْتَلُواْ الْيَتَـمَى]
</p>
</div>
<p>(And test orphans) meaning, test their intelligence, as Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan stated.
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>[حَتَّى إِذَا بَلَغُواْ النِّكَاحَ]
</p>
</div>
<p>(until they reach the age of marriage), the age of puberty, according to Mujahid. The age of puberty according to the majority of scholars comes when the child has a wet dream. In his Sunan, Abu Dawud recorded that `Ali said, &quot;I memorized these words from the Messenger of Allah ,
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>«لَا يُتْمَ بَعْدَ احْتِلَامٍ، وَلَا صُمَاتَ يَوْمٍ إِلَى اللَّيْل»
</p>
</div>
<p>(There is no orphan after the age of puberty nor vowing to be silent throughout the day to the night.) In another Hadith, `A'ishah and other Companions said that the Prophet said,
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>«رُفِعَ الْقَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلَاثَةٍ، عَنِ الصَّبِيِّ حَتَّى يَحْتَلِمَ، وَعَنِ النَّائِمِ حَتَّى يَسْتَيْقِظَ، وَعَنِ الْمَجْنُونِ حَتَّى يُفِيق»
</p>
</div>
<p>s(The pen does not record the deeds of three persons: the child until the age of puberty, the sleeping person until waking up, and the senile until sane.) Or, the age of fifteen is considered the age of adolescence. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn `Umar said, &quot;I was presented in front of the Prophet on the eve of the battle of Uhud, while I was fourteen years of age, and he did not allow me to take part in that battle. But I was presented in front of him on the eve of the battle of Al-Khandaq (The Trench) when I was fifteen years old, and he allowed me (to join that battle).<i> `Umar bin `Abdul-`Aziz commented when this Hadith reached him, &quot;This is the difference between a child and an adult.</i> There is a difference of opinion over whether pubic hair is considered a sign of adulthood, and the correct opinion is that it is. The Sunnah supports this view, according to a Hadith collected by Imam Ahmad from `Atiyah Al-Qurazi who said, We were presented to the Prophet on the day of Qurizah, whoever had pubic hair was killed, whoever did not was left free to go, I was one of those who did not, so I was left free.<i> The Four Sunan compilers also recorded similar to it. At-Tirmidhi said, &quot;Hasan Sahih.</i> Allah's statement,
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>[فَإِنْ ءَانَسْتُمْ مِّنْهُمْ رُشْداً فَادْفَعُواْ إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَلَهُمْ]
</p>
</div>
(if then you find sound judgment in them, release their property to them,) Sa`id bin Jubayr said that this portion of the Ayah means, when you find them to be good in the religion and wise with their money. Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others among the Imams.

Try, test, well the orphans, before reaching maturity with regard [the duties of] religion and [before] they can [legally] manage their own affairs, until they reach the age of marrying, that is, until they have become eligible for it through puberty or [legal] age, which, according to al-Shāfi‘ī, is the completion of fifteen years; then, if you perceive in them maturity, that is, right [judgement] in matters of religion and their property, deliver their property to them; consume it not, O guardians, wastefully, without due merit, and in haste, that is, hastening to expend it, fearing, lest they should grow up, and become mature, at which time you will be obliged to hand it over to them. If any man, who is a guardian, is rich, let him be abstinent, that is, let him abstain from the orphan’s property and refrain from consuming it; if he is poor, let him consume, of it, honourably, that is, in line with the wage for his work. And when you deliver to them, the orphans, their property, take witnesses over them, that they have received it and that you are absolved [of the obligation], so that if any dispute occurs, you are able to refer to a clear proof: this is a command [intended] for guidance. God suffices as a reckoner, as a guardian of His creatures’ deeds and as a reckoner of these [deeds] (the bā’ [in bi’Llāhi] is extra).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=4&tAyahNo=6&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=4&tAyahNo=6&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2">Qur'an 4:6</a><br>Tafsir al-Jalalayn</div></div>

(Prove orphans) test the intelligence of orphans (till they reach the marriageable age) the age of puberty; (then, if ye find them of) if you see that they possess (sound judgement) righteousness in Religion and a tendency to protect their wealth, (deliver over unto them their fortune) then give their wealth which is with you; (and devour it not squandering) it in transgression and unlawfully (and in haste) in haste lest the orphan grows older and consumes it little by little (lest they should grow up) for fear that they grow older and stop you from devouring their wealth. (Whoso (of the guardians) is rich) and needs not the orphan's wealth, (let him abstain generously) because of his richness from taking of the property of orphans, nor should he diminish anything from their wealth; (and whoso is poor) and needy (let him take thereof in reason (for his guardianship)) in measure, such that he is not in need for the wealth of orphans; it is also said that this means: he should take from the wealth of orphans in proportion with the measure of his work regarding this wealth; and it is also said that this means: he can take from the wealth of orphans as a loan to be paid back.

(Prove orphans…) [4:6]. This was revealed about Thabit ibn Rifa‘ah and his uncle. Rifa‘ah died when his son Thabit was very young. The uncle of Thabit went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: “The son of my brother is an orphan under my care, what is lawful for me from his wealth?

<p>In the above verses, the word <i>&quot;Nisa&quot;</i> is referring to female infants. To understand this clearly, we must look to the Exodus account, because these verses were plagiarized from the Bible.
</p>
<div class="quotes"><i>&quot;And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah; and he said: ‘When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, ye shall look upon the birthstool: if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.’</i><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%201:15-16;&version=49;?search=Exodus%201:15-16;&version=49;">Exodus 1:15-16</a></div></div>

<p>In summary, when Muslims asked Muhammad who the &quot;Nisa&quot; were, he said they were the:
</p>
<ol><li> Orphans </li>
<li> Female wards </li>
<li> Those you desire to marry </li>
<li> The weakened from the children or new born.</li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="This_verse_applies_to_married_teenagers">This verse applies to married teenagers</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"> There is an alternative interpretation that does not involve pederasty, which is sexual activity between young girls and boys, i.e. early teenage years when menstruation may not have begun (or become regular) among girls, who are married to boys similar in age. This type of marriage was not uncommon in Semitic cultures, for example some scholars suggest that Mary (the mother of Jesus) was somewhere between the ages of twelve and fourteen when she married Joseph (although it should be noted that non-canonical gospels suggest Joseph was a mature man, possibly as old as ninety<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>).
Given that sexual activity among teenagers is common among many cultures, including Western ones, this appears to be the most reasonable interpretation. <br> </div>
<p>Given the evidence from the Islamic texts themselves, this interpretation is not the 'most reasonable' as asserted. We have ample <a href="wiki/Muhammad_and_the_Clinical_Definition_of_Pedophilia.html" title="Muhammad and the Clinical Definition of Pedophilia">evidence</a> that  Muhammad (who is considered the <a href="wiki/Uswa_Hasana.html" title="Uswa Hasana">uswa hasana</a> - perfect example) married and had sex with a pre-pubescent Aisha, we have evidence that <a href="wiki/Muhammad's_Companions_and_Pedophilia.html" title="Muhammad's Companions and Pedophilia">Muhammad's companions also did it</a> and that <a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html" title="Contemporary Pedophilic Islamic Marriages">Muslims to this very day</a> are marrying pre-pubescent females and having intercourse with them. In none of these cases are the husbands comparable in age to the wife. So even though this is a <i>possible</i> interpretation, it is by no means the <i>only reason</i> that Muhammad revealed this verse - as evidenced also in the tafsir's provided above. Simply put, Muhammad did not specify an 'iddah for those whom menstruation was not present, so one had to be sent regarding these 3 groups of women. Nowhere in the Qur'an or the ahadith does it discuss teenagers marrying teenagers (ie. to 'explain' this verse) and all the evidence that we have points to [much] older men marrying and having sexual relations with pre-pubescent females.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="65.4_talks_only_of_the_.27Iddah_and_not_of_sexual_activity">65.4 talks only of the 'Iddah and not of sexual activity</span></h3>
<p>Often pointed out is the fact that 65.4 does not explictly discuss consummation or other sexual activity in regards to any of the females discussed in the verse; it merely sets the prescribed 'Iddah required for each. The 'iddah (prescribed waiting period) for females is required after a divorce or widowing, so that a child's father can be correctly idenfitied.  This is established in Qur'an 33:49. The verse is quoted above. 
</p><p>Here are some tafsirs on this ayah:
</p>
<div class="quotes"><div align="right">
(يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا فَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ وَسَرِّحُوهُنَّ سَرَاحاً جَمِيلاً)</div>
<p>49. O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no `Iddah have you to count in respect of them. So, give them a present, and set them free in a handsome manner.)
</p><p>This Ayah contains many rulings, including the use of the word Nikah for the marriage contract alone. There is no other Ayah in the Qur'an that is clearer than this on this point. It also indicates that it is permissible to divorce a woman before consummating the marriage with her.
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(الْمُؤْمِنَـتِ)
</p>
</div>
<p>(believing women)
This refers to what is usually the case, although there is no difference between a believing (Muslim) woman and a woman of the People of the Book in this regard, according to scholarly consensus. Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, `Ali bin Al-Husayn Zayn-ul-`Abidin and a group of the Salaf took this Ayah as evidence that divorce cannot occur unless it has been preceded by marriage, because Allah says,
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ)
</p>
</div>
<p>(When you marry believing women, and then divorce them) 
</p><p>The marriage contract here is followed by divorce, which indicates that the divorce cannot be valid if it comes first. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &quot;If someone were to say, `every woman I marry will ipso facto be divorced,' this does not mean anything, because Allah says:
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ)
</p>
</div>
<p>(O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them....).<i> It was also reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: &quot;Allah said,</i>
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(إِذَا نَكَحْتُمُ الْمُؤْمِنَـتِ ثُمَّ طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ)
</p>
</div>
<p>(When you marry believing women, and then divorce them.) Do you not see that divorce comes after marriage<i> A Hadith to the same effect was recorded from `Amr bin Shu`ayb from his father from his grandfather, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah said:</i>
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>«لَا طَلَاقَ لِابْنِ آدَمَ فِيمَا لَا يَمْلِك»
</p>
</div>
<p>(There is no divorce for the son of Adam with regard to that which he does not possess.) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah. At-Tirmidhi said, &quot;This is a Hasan Hadith, and it is the best thing that has been narrated on this matter.<i> It was also recorded by Ibn Majah from `Ali and Al-Miswar bin Makhramah, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Messenger of Allah said:</i>
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>«لَا طَلَاقَ قَبْلَ نِكَاح»
</p>
</div>
<p>(There is no divorce before marriage.)
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا)
</p>
</div>
<p>(no `Iddah have you to count in respect of them.) This is a command on which the scholars are agreed, that if a woman is divorced before the marriage is consummated, she does not have to observe the `Iddah (prescribed period for divorce) and she may go and get married immediately to whomever she wishes. The only exception in this regard is a woman whose husband died, in which case she has to observe an `Iddah of four months and ten days even if the marriage was not consummated. This is also according to the consensus of the scholars.
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(فَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ وَسَرِّحُوهُنَّ سَرَاحاً جَمِيلاً)
</p>
</div>
<p>(So, give them a present, and set them free in a handsome manner.) The present here refers to something more general than half of the named dowery or a special gift that has not been named. Allah says:
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(وَإِن طَلَّقْتُمُوهُنَّ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَمَسُّوهُنَّ وَقَدْ فَرَضْتُمْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً فَنِصْفُ مَا فَرَضْتُمْ)
</p>
</div>
<p>(And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have fixed unto them their due (dowery) then pay half of that) (2:237). And Allah says:
</p>
<div align="right">
<p>(لاَّ جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ إِن طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ مَا لَمْ تَمَسُّوهُنَّ أَوْ تَفْرِضُواْ لَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً وَمَتِّعُوهُنَّ عَلَى الْمُوسِعِ قَدَرُهُ وَعَلَى الْمُقْتِرِ قَدْرُهُ مَتَـعاً بِالْمَعْرُوفِ حَقًّا عَلَى الْمُحْسِنِينَ)
</p>
</div>
(There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them, nor fixed unto them their due (dowery). But bestow on them gift, the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.) (2:236) pIn Sahih Al-Bukhari, it was recorded that Sahl bin Sa`d and Abu Usayd, may Allah be pleased with them both, said, &quot;The Messenger of Allah married Umaymah bint Sharahil, and when she entered upon him he reached out his hand towards her, and it was as if she did not like that, so he told Abu Usayd to give her two garments.<i> `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said &quot;If the dowery had been named, she would not be entitled to more than half, but if the dowery is not been named, he should give her a gift according to his means, and this is the &quot;handsome manner.</i><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1841&Itemid=89#1?option=com_content&task=view&id=1841&Itemid=89#1">A Gift and no (Iddah) for Women Who are divorced before Consummation of the Marriage (Qur'an 33:49)</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>

(But content them) as is due by divorce by giving them at least a scarf or shawl (and release them handsomely) divorce them without any harm done to them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=33&tAyahNo=49&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=33&tAyahNo=49&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0">Qur'an 33:49</a><br>Tafsir 'Ibn Abbas</div></div>
<p>This verse effectively removes the apologist's objection to Qur'an 65.4 as we see clearly that if a man has not consummated his marriage with his wife then she does not need to observe an 'iddah. If Qur'an 65.4 specifies that pre-pubescent females must observe a 3 month 'iddah then clearly sexual intercourse is halal to Allah.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="This_verse_is_only_talking_about_adult_women_who_don.27t_know_if_they_are_pregnant">This verse is only talking about adult women who don't know if they are pregnant</span></h3>
<p>The very reason 65:4 was revealed in the first place, was as a clarification to an existing revelation by Allah. Allah had already revealed that women must wait 3 menstrual periods before they can end the 'iddat and be free to marry again. This is in Qur'an 2:228:
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>And the divorced women should keep themselves in waiting for three courses; and it is not lawful for them that they should conceal what Allah has created in their wombs</b>, if they believe in Allah and the last day; and their husbands have a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for reconciliation; and they have rights similar to those against them in a just manner, and the men are a degree above them, and Allah is Mighty, Wise. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.228#002.228">2:228</a></div></div>
<p>However, after this, Muslim men went to Muhammad to ask about those who did not presently have their menses - how do they measure the 'iddat in those cases? It is in this circumstance that Allah sent down the clarification (65:4) for the three groups of women that did not have menstruation, therefore they could not wait the '3 menstrual cycles' as mandated by Qur'an 2:228.
</p><p>Those Muslims who make this claim are ignoring what all of their own scholars have said about 65:4; that it is referring to the peri-menopausal and post menopausal women, the pre-pubescent girls and the pregnant women. The women who are currently menstruating are told in Qur'an 2:228 that they must wait 3 menstrual cycles, therefore this apologetic is also debunked.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="This_verse_is_applied_to_unconsummated_widows">This verse is applied to unconsummated widows</span></h3>
<p>Another claim is that Qur'an 65.4 doesn't necessarily mean that Muslim men can have sex with pre-pubescent females because there may be cases where a man has married a pre-pubescent female, but while waiting for her to attain menstruation before consummating the marriage, he died. The 'iddah could be referring to a situation such as this.  This claim is invalid because the Qur'an specifies the 'iddah for <i>all</i> widows to be 4 months and 10 days; in Qur'an 2:234:
</p>
<div class="quotes">And (as for) those of you who die and leave wives behind, they should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days; then when they have fully attained their term, there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner; and Allah is aware of what you do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.234#002.234">2:234</a></div></div>
<p>This verse clearly contradicts this particular apologist claim, since the 'Iddah specified in Qur'an 65.4 is for a different amount of time, therefore the verses are referring to different situations.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an in verse 33:49 states that no 'Iddah is prescribed for a woman who has <i>not</i> had intimate contact with her husband, but goes on to stipulate the 'Iddah for pre-pubescent girls in verse 65:4, meaning the holiest text of Islam supports marrying and having sex with prepubescent girls. This is definitive proof that the Qur'an endorses pedophilia, something that is considered by many people to be the most serious of all sexual crimes.
