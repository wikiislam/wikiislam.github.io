<div class="quotes">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &quot;A prophet amongst the prophets carried out a holy military expedition, so he said to his followers, 'Anyone who has married a woman and wants to consummate the marriage, and has not done so yet, should not accompany me; nor should a man who has built a house but has not completed its roof; nor a man who has sheep or shecamels and is waiting for the birth of their young ones.' So, the prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly at the time of the 'Asr prayer, he said to the sun, 'O sun! You are under Allah's Order and I am under Allah's Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Allah made him victorious.
<p><br>
</p>
Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it did not burn it. He said (to his men), 'Some of you have stolen something from the booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over the hand of their prophet. Then that prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your people. So all the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with me.' The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said, &quot;You have committed the theft.' Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. <b>The Prophet added: Then Allah saw our weakness and disability, so he made booty legal for us.&quot;</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/053-sbt.php#004.053.353#004.053.353">4:53:353</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">The Spoils of War surah was handed down because we quarreled about the booty. So Allah took it away from us and gave it to His Apostle.

For in truth, our army had gone out with the Prophet seeking the caravan because we wanted its booty.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:321</div></div>

<div class="quotes">When their wrists were bound with cords, the Apostle was a sea of generosity to us. Allah's Messenger took his fifth of the booty.

<div class="quotes">When the spoil of Khaybar was apportioned, the settlements of Shaqq and Nata were given to the Muslims while Katiba was divided into five sections: Allah's fifth [which Muhammad was custodian]; the Prophet's fifth; the share to the kindred [Muhammad's kin]; maintenance of the Prophet's wives; and payment to the men who acted as intermediaries in the peace negotiation with Fadak.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:521</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Then the Apostle distributed the booty between his relatives, his wives, and to other men and women. He gave his daughter Fatima 200 shares, Ali 100, Usama 250, Aisha 200, Bakr 100…. In the name of Allah—this is a memorandum of what Muhammad the Apostle gave his wives from the dates and wheat: 180 loads.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:522</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I went up to a man and struck off his hand. He fell and I killed him while he was down. But I was too occupied with fighting to pay any more attention to him. So one of the Meccan Muslims passed by and stripped him. Then when the fighting was over and we had finished with the enemy, the Apostle said that anyone who had killed a foe could have his spoil. I told the Apostle that I had killed a man who was worth stripping but had been too busy killing others at the time to notice who had spoiled him. Abu Bakr said, &quot;To Allah's lions who fight for His religion go the spoils that come from their prey. Return the booty to the man who killed him.' The Apostle confirmed Abu Bakr's words. So I was given the property of the man whom I had killed. I sold it and bought a small palm grove with the money. It was the first property I ever owned.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ishaq:571</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Messenger of Allah gave orders concerning the contents of the camp which the people had collected, and it was all brought together. Among the Muslims, however, there was a difference of opinion concerning it. Those who had collected it said, ‘It is ours. Muhammad promised every man that he could keep the booty he took.' Those who were fighting said, ‘If it had not been for us, you would not have taken it. We distracted the enemy from you so that you could take what you took.' Those who were guarding the Prophet for fear the enemy would attack him said, ‘By Allah, you have no better right to it than we have. We wanted to kill the enemy when Allah gave us the opportunity and made them turn their backs, and we wanted to take property when there was no one to protect it; but we were afraid that the Meccans might attack the Prophet. We protected him so you have no better right to it than we have.' When we quarreled about the booty we became very bad tempered. So Allah removed it from us and handed it over to His Messenger.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_VII:_The_Foundation_of_the_Community" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 7, p. 64</a>, See Also Ishaq:307</div></div>
