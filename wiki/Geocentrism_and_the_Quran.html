<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Some may confuse geocentricism with the the idea that the <a href="wiki/Flat_Earth_and_the_Quran.html" title="Flat Earth and the Quran">Earth is flat</a>. This is not the case. These are two different ideas. Geocentrism simply is the notion that the earth is the (immovable) centre of our universe, thus all celestial bodies mover around it. The ancient Greeks and the Europeans of the middle ages thought that the celestial bodies (the sun, the moon and the 5 known planets) all moved in celestial spheres around a spherical earth. It should be noted that even though not all geocentrists are flat-earthers invariably all flat-earthers seem to be geocentrists.
</p><p>It seems the author of the Qur'an thought that the sun (and the moon and the five known planets) followed a curved (rounded) course (a Falak).<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> According to the Qur'an this falak starts in the east (where the sun goes up), goes high above the earth and ends after sunset with the Sun resting at night at a hidden place. All this took place around an earth that was spread out and had a firmament built on invisible pillars above it. This was a common belief at the time and can be found with the Babylonians, ancient Hebrews, the Assyrians and other cultures in the region. In that regard it may be interesting to note that the Tawaf (the circling of the Ka'aba) mimics these seven orbits.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Primary_Evidence">Primary Evidence</span></h2>
<p>The evidence for the Qur'an’s geocentricity will be dealt with in several paragraphs, supported by evidence from the Qur'an, Muslim daily practice, Muslim scientists and the <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>. 
Even though some Muslims reject the Hadith and the <a href="wiki/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> as being not-divinely inspired; that argument presupposes a priori that the Qur'an is divinely inspired and protected whilst these other documents are not. Obviously, such special pleading will not do in a scholarly examination of the Qur'an. The Qur'an alone cannot prove itself to be Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad’s</a> words (let alone the words of <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>) without the support of hadiths. Not only are these sources useful as supporting evidence; they also indicate which interpretation is supported by Muhammad and (early) Muslims. This is also why this article includes the views of several medieval Muslim Astronomers: if the Qur'an had clearly described a cosmology that is not geocentric, they would simply not hold geocentric views. In addition, this article even includes the opinions of a modern-day Muslim astronomer.
</p><p>The following is a list of what makes the Qur'an geocentric:
</p>
<ol><li> It is very clear from the Qur'an and scientific observations that the moon makes rounds around the earth. The Qur'an mentions the sun and the moon in such a way as if they are following each other.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li> The floating/swimming/running (the verb جري) of the sun is always mentioned with that of the moon, and in these verses they are nearly always mentioned in the context of night and day.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></li>
<li> <p>Qur'an 36:37-40 is a passage about night and day.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Right after describing the change from day to night it says that the sun runs on to a resting place for it.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> There are also sahih hadith that use the same Arabic word as in verse 36:38 to mean a resting place as part of the sun's daily cycle.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> </p><p>The alternative view was that it refers to the sun's final resting on the last day.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Another similar sahih hadith probably supports this view.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Whichever interpretation was intended, the sun's movement is nevertheless mentioned right after describing day and night, just as the next verse mentions the different mansions appointed for the moon each night. The whole passage is about day and night and the sun and moon's movement in that context.</p></li>
<li> There is only one moon and one sun in the entire Qur'anic universe. The position of all these celestial bodies within this universe are clearly described in the Qur'an. For example, the heavens are above the earth, and the sun, moon and stars are within the heavens.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></li>
<li> The Qur'an mentions heavenly bodies traveling in their own orbits, but so do the concepts of day and night each have an orbit. None of the bodies are supposed to run into each other.</li>
<li> The heavens are firmly held in place lest they move from where they are and fall on the earth.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Note that there is no mention of orbits for the heavens or the earth in the Qur'an. Their positions are fixed. An orbit is only mentioned for the sun and the moon. Not even the stars have an orbit, for they are as if hanging down from the heavens like a light bulb from the ceiling in a room. </li></ol>
<p>For the Qur'an to be scientific, it must contain accurate statements in regards to all that is visible i.e. material objects and phenomena. How can Allah appeal to such things as signs of his power and existence if he fails to make his case obvious?
</p><p>All the evidence in the Qur'an points very strongly to the fact that the author had been observing the universe, not from the heavens, but from the Arabian Desert. The author states that the heavens are above the earth. Why? Because they were looking at the heavens from the Arabian floor and not from the vast space above or below. Otherwise Allah would have seen the Milky Way as a disc. Our solar system too is a disc. The earth is just one of the planets moving around the sun. However, in the the Qur'an, the sky is mistakenly being referred to as if it were a solid structure that could fall upon the earth and crush people and things between them. There are verses upon verses which lead to these conclusions.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_sun_and_moon_are_signs_from_Allah">The sun and moon are signs from Allah</span></h3>
<p>According to the Qur'an, the sun and the moon are some of the signs (al ayaat) that are created by Allah. In the Qur'an, Allah also promises to &quot;explain his signs in detail, for people who have knowledge.&quot;
</p>
<div class="quotes">It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. Allāh did not create this but in truth. <b>He explains the signs in detail for people who have knowledge.</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/010-qmt.php#010.005#010.005">10:5</a></div></div>
<p><i>Yussuf Ali - (he explains in detail) al ayaat (the signs) Li (for) Qawmin (people) Yalamoon (knowing).</i>
</p><p><a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">Apologists</a> may say that these detailed explanation are only correctly understood by them (since only they have knowledge); but this is of course circular reasoning. (&quot;You first have to believe the Qur'an to be 100% true to be qualified to criticize its veracity.&quot;) Even if this were true, these Muslim possessors of 'true' knowledge should be able to provide a coherent, unambiguous explanation of the Qur'an and its miraculous signs - and if how early learned Muslims (including Muhammad himself) explained these verses was examined by them, they would find that they confirm a geocentric cosmology.
</p><p>Here is another verse where basically the same sentiment is being expressed: 
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Allah is He who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see; is firmly established on the throne; <b>He has subjected the sun and the moon! Each one runs for a term appointed</b>. He regulates the matter, <b>explaining the signs in detail</b>, so you can be certain of meeting with your Lord.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/013-qmt.php#013.002#013.002">13:2</a></div></div>
<p><i>yudabbiru (he arranges / regulates) al amra (the matter) yufassilu (he explains in detail) al ayaat (the signs) la allakum (so you may) biliqai (meeting) rabbikum (with your Lord) tūqinūna (be certain)</i>
</p><p>The sun and moon running their courses are signs (ayaat) to mankind and thus they must be visible (or known) to a 7<sup>th</sup> century Arab audience. The Qur'an also promises to explain these signs in detail. And with good reason because they are proofs for the people so they can be certain that someday they will meet Allah.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_visibility_of_the_sun.27s_movement">The visibility of the sun's movement</span></h3>
<p>The movement of the sun (as well as the course of the moon) is visible according the author of the Qur'an.
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Don't you see</b> that Allah merges night into day and he merges day into night and he has subjected the sun, and the moon each running its course for a term appointed. And Allah is aware of what you do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/031-qmt.php#031.029#031.029">31:29</a></div></div> 
<p>These were all visible phenomena to the people of the 7<sup>th</sup> century; they could 'see' the night turn into day and vice versa, they could see the sun and the moon run their courses around the earth. The people could see Allah's signs, and Allah could see them. At various places in the Qur'an, numerous observers 'see' the sun go up, reach its highest point, then go back down to its resting place.
</p><p>أَلَمْ تَرَ = Alam Tara (”Don’t you see?&quot;) 
</p><p>It could be argued that &quot;don't you see&quot; means &quot;don't you know&quot; or &quot;aren't you aware&quot; or &quot;don't you realise&quot;. Of course this does not make much of a difference. In this case, the Qur'an clearly reinforces the common but incorrect beliefs of the time, and further uses these erroneous beliefs to support the existence of Allah.
</p>
<div class="quotes">[…] He made the Sun and the moon subservient; each one pursues its course to an appointed time; He regulates the affair, <b>making clear the signs</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/013-qmt.php#013.002#013.002">13:2</a></div></div>
<p>Here is how the Qur'an tells of an indirect observation of the sun's movement. The author of the Qur'an explains how the shadow cast by the sun is guided by the sun's movement:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Have you not <b>seen</b> see how your Lord spread the shadow. If He willed he could make it stationary. Then do We make the sun its guide.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/025-qmt.php#025.045#025.045">25:45</a></div></div> 
<p>الشَّمسَ عَلَيهِ دَلِيل = ash shamsa (the sun) `alayhi (for it) dalilaan (a guide / an indication)
</p><p>According to the Qur'an, the shadow that the sun casts are moving because of the sun. And humans should be able to see this. Of course, this is exactly how it would appear to someone observing the phenomena standing on earth; however, this is not how it would be described if it was being viewed from outside our solar system. It is not the sun but the rotation of earth which causes shadows to change shape. 
</p><p>Interestingly, the length of the shadow cast by the sun is also used to determine the start of the Asr prayer time; the apparent movement of the sun is still used by Muslims as a clock of sorts.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Art thou not aware of thy Sustainer [through His works]? - how He causes the shadow to lengthen [towards the night] when, had He so willed, He could indeed have made it stand still: but then, We have made the sun its guide;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/025-qmt.php#025.045#025.045">25:45</a></div></div>
<p>However, according to a better English translation of the Qur'an, the sun's influence over the shadow is only part of the hypothetical situation in which Allah makes the shadow constant. In such a case, indeed, the earth's influence over the shadow's length becomes naught (since it only arises if the earth stops moving), and the sun's influence becomes singular.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_course_of_the_sun_in_relation_to_the_course_of_the_moon">The course of the sun in relation to the course of the moon</span></h3>
<p>The courses of the sun and the moon are also a pair of sorts, according to the Qur'an:<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

<div class="quotes"> He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected the sun and the moon (to His law): Each one follows a course for a time appointed.

<p>And again: the Qur'an explains, not only are humans <a href="wiki/Quranic_Claim_of_Everything_Created_in_Pairs.html" title="Quranic Claim of Everything Created in Pairs">created in pairs</a> (male and female), so are the two bodies of flowing waters (one salt and one sweet), and the night and the day and the sun and the moon.

<div class="quotes">[…]1 And Allah did create you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then He made you in pairs. And no female conceives, or lays down (her load), but with His knowledge. Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Decree (ordained). All this is easy to Allah.  Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike,- the one palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other, salt and bitter. Yet from each (kind of water) do ye eat flesh fresh and tender, and ye extract ornaments to wear; and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek (thus) of the Bounty of Allah that ye may be grateful.

<p>Notice how frequently the sun and the moon are mentioned together as a pair. Its clearly implied that the sun and the moon are a pair of sorts, just like (according to the Qur'an) the heavens and the earth or the night and the day. In Qur'an 36:36 and 35:11-35:13 this belief is expressly stated. The sun and the moon (along with their courses) are mentioned amongst a range of other things that are created in pairs.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_regular_cycle_of_the_sun">The regular cycle of the sun</span></h3>
<p>According to the Qur'an, the sun's cycle is repeated on a regular basis (exactly computed even) just like that of the Moon and night and day.

<p>This Surah reads: Alshamsu (the sun) waalqamaru (and the moon) bihusbanin.
</p><p><i>Husban</i> can mean a number of things: definite reckoning, appointed courses, numbering, revolving firmament, running appointed and scheduled course. In many English translations  we see the word 'course' or 'celestial sphere' but note that the word 'falak' isn't mentioned here; this verse only indicates that the sun and the moon behave in a calculated / scheduled / appointed manner. 
</p><p>There is a reason why this is important: the sun's daily cycle and the moons monthly cycle are used for timekeeping in Islam.
</p><p>This cycle is repeated every day:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> A token unto them is night. <b>We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness and the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him.</b> That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise.

<p>The Qur'an clearly tells us that the sun follows a daily cycle, which ends every night when the sun goes to its resting place. (ِمُسْتَقَرٍّ) Waalshshamsu (and the sun) tajree (runs) limustaqarrin (a resting point) laha (of it). Notice how the sun's movement is repeatedly mentioned in the context of night and day. 
</p><p>A standard apologetic claim is that references to the sun's movement concern its 225 million year orbit around the milky way. Such a meaning would have no relevance to human timescales, nor would it be &quot;a token&quot; or sign for 7<sup>th</sup> century listeners, nor would it make sense in the context about the night-day cycle. Moreover, the idea that the sun is prevented from overtaking the moon is a concept that would only make any kind of sense from a naive human perspective where they orbit the same world.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_movement_of_the_sun_and_timekeeping">The movement of the sun and timekeeping</span></h3>
<p>In the days of Muhammad it was common practice to use the sun for timekeeping, so there is little wonder that the Qur'an claims the supposed course of the Sun is a sign from Allah to keep track of the time of day (and likewise the course of the moon is a monthly calendar)

<p>The moon (the sign of the night) is to be used to count the years (12 <a href="wiki/Islamic_Lunar_Calendar.html" title="Islamic Lunar Calendar">lunar years</a> make up the Islamic year) and the sun is to be used to keep track of time. The only solar movement Muslims use for timekeeping is the apparent daily course of the Sun (from east up and then down to the west). To this very day, Muslims use the (crude) lunar calender, and the waqt (prescribed time) of their daily <a href="wiki/Salah.html" title="Salah">salats</a> (prayers) is determined entirely  by the position of the Sun along it’s apparent course.
</p><p><b>Daily salats:</b>
</p>
<ol><li>Salat Al Fajr – right before sun rise. (mentioned in <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php#024.058#024.058">24:58</a>)</li>
<li>Salat Al Zuhr – right after the Sun’s zenith, but before the shadow of the Sun becomes twice its length from midday.</li>
<li>Salat Al Asr- between zenith and sunset (when the length of a shadow of a stick is either once or twice its length) </li>
<li>Salat Al Maghrib – right after sunset. (Mentioned in <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/017-qmt.php#017.078#017.078">17:78</a>)</li>
<li>Salat Al Isha'a – between sunset and sunrise.</li></ol>
<p>The picture is pretty clear: the apparent daily course of the sun dictates the time of each and every daily prayer. And this is important for Muslims.

<div class="quotes">[...]'<i> prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times.</i><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.103#004.103">4:103</a></div></div>
<p>There are other examples of how the sun's apparent movement along the sky is used to know what time it is or to make appointments during the day:

<p>The Qur'an is clear; the apparent course of the sun is to be used for timekeeping ('reckoning') and the only examples of the sun being used for timekeeping in the Qur'an employs the sun's daily movement along the sky.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_shape_of_the_sun.27s_course">The shape of the sun's course</span></h3>
<p>These verses explain the shape of the sun's course.  Apparently the sun goes up from east, travels high and eventually goes down to the west.
</p><p>The sun rises (goes up) in the east:

<p>Here the course of the sun is described as a sign (ayat). Note that the rising of the sun is compared (again) to the rising of the moon (the same words are used). However, the moon is in an orbit around the earth, whilst the sun is not.

<div class="quotes">Thou wouldst have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the open space in the midst of the Cave.

<p>The Qur'an clearly assumes the sun ends its daily cycle every night when the sun goes to its resting place. (ِمُسْتَقَرٍّ or mustaqarrin).<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>The Qur'an also describes the locations where the sun can be seen to go up and down.  It can be seen by human eyes in the story of <a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn.html" title="Dhul-Qarnayn">Dhul-Qarnayn</a> (Alexander the Great):
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road.

<p>The place where the sun goes down has a name 'Mahgreb' (from the root ghuroob, meaning &quot;to set&quot; or &quot;to be hidden by going away&quot;). Today, North-Western Africa (Morocco in particular) is denoted by this very name. Interestingly, if one stands there and looks at the ocean at sunset one could 'observe' the sun going to its hidden resting place.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Qur'an is quite clear about the course of the sun. It does not even describe a complete orbit, but merely a rounded course (falak) that has a beginning, an end, and a highest point.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_similar_size_and_distance_of_the_sun_and_moon">The similar size and distance of the sun and moon</span></h3>
<p>The Qur'an has some statements about the end of the world that are much as one would expect if the author believed the sun and moon to be of similar size and a similar distance from Earth.
</p>
<div class="quotes">And the moon darkens And the sun and the moon are joined,<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/075-qmt.php#075.008#075.008">75:8-9</a></div></div>
<p>The word translated &quot;are joined&quot; is Arabic jumi'a, a verb which means to collect together, gather together, bring together.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Now given that this would actually require the moon to travel 98 million miles away from Earth and into the sun, which is over 600 times wider, it is far less suitable as an apocalyptic event than if the ancient understanding of the cosmos was correct, and it is not credible that an author with accurate knowledge of the solar system would describe such an event using the words found in these verses.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Supporting_Evidence">Supporting Evidence</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_and_modern-day_Muslim_astronomers">Ancient and modern-day Muslim astronomers</span></h3>
<p>Muslims living in Muhammad’s day unequivocally accepted the Qur'an's geocentric cosmology. References in the Hadith of any of the ansari or others in Muhammad's environment arguing about this point with their prophet or amongst themselves are unknown. Famous Muslim astronomers (people who certainly read, and knew the Qur'an) like the Arab astronomer <i>Ibn al-Shatir</i> and the Persian <i>Nasir al-Din al-Tusi</i> used Greek (geocentric) astronomy to create complex models of our ‘universe’ (basically only our solar system, which they believed constituted the entire universe) that were geocentric just like the Qur'an. 
</p><p>In a televised debate aired on Iraqi Al-Fayhaa TV (October 31, 2007), Muslim Researcher on Astronomy <i>Fadhel Al-Sa'd</i> also declared :
</p>
<div class="quotes">The sun circles the Earth because it is smaller than the Earth, as is evident in Koranic verses. Have you ever seen how the sun moves? I have seen the sun moving. The sun makes one move every 24 hours.<br><br>What I say is based on Koranic science. He bases his arguments on the kind of science that I reject categorically -- the modern science that they teach in schools. This science is a heretic innovation that has no confirmation in the Koran. No verse in the Koran indicates that the Earth is round or that it rotates. Anything that has no indication in the Koran is false.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1684.htm">Iraqi Researcher Defies Scientific Axioms: The Earth Is Flat and Much Larger than the Sun (Which Is Also Flat)</a><br>MEMRI TV, Video No. 1684</div></div>
<p>According to Fadhel Al-Sa'd, the moon's diameter is 1,200,000 km, while that of the sun is only 2,400,000 km.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muslims_around_the_time_of_Muhammad">Muslims around the time of Muhammad</span></h3>
<p>In the Hadiths we read Muhammad's own words, and they clearly paint the same picture: the sun moves around the earth and goes to a resting place at night.

<div class="quotes">It is narrated on the authority of Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) one day said: Do you know where the Sun goes? They replied: Allah and His Apostle know best. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Verily it (the Sun) glides till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it falls prostrate and remains there until it is asked: Rise up and go to the place whence you came, and it goes back and continues emerging out from its rising place and then glides till it reaches its place of rest under the Throne and falls prostrate and remains in that state until it is asked: Rise up and return to the place whence you came, and it returns and emerges out from it rising place and the it glides (in such a normal way) that the people do not discern anything (unusual in it) till it reaches its resting place under the Throne. Then it would be said to it: Rise up and emerge out from the place of your setting, and it will rise from the place of its setting. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said. Do you know when it would happen? It would happen at the time when faith will not benefit one who has not previously believed or has derived no good from the faith.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/001-smt.php#001.0297#001.0297">1:297</a></div></div>

<p>Even though these Hadiths are all deemed '<a href="wiki/Sahih.html" title="Sahih">sahih</a>' (authentic) according to Islamic scholars, some apologists will deny them without any valid reason other than for their anti-scientific nature. Of course the Hadiths, at the very least, indicate what Muslims around the time of Muhammad (or not long after his demise) believed about the sun and how to interpret the Qur'an correctly.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>A lot of details about the sun’s movement are contained within the Qur'an. 
</p><p>According to the Qur'an, the supposed course of the sun:
</p>
<ol><li>is seen by 7th century listeners without knowledge of galactic orbits.</li>
<li>is (almost always) compared to the Moon's course.</li>
<li>is repeated regularly.</li>
<li>is almost always mentioned with that of the moon in the context of night and day.</li>
<li>is to be used by the Muslims for timekeeping.</li>
<li>has a destination. Beginning in the east, it goes up to a high point, then goes down to the west.</li></ol>
<p>In addition to all these facts; great ancient, and even modern-day, Muslim astronomers agree that the Qur'an is geocentric, and the Hadiths also affirm this geocentric cosmology (so Muhammad or at least the people around him agree with it)
</p><p>What else can one conclude, other than the Qur'an is geocentric? Whoever wrote the Qur'an thought that the sun orbits our planet. It is now known this is not true: the sun is not orbiting our planet and it is certainly not in a daily rounded path that looks like half a circle. 
</p><p>In ancient times, many people - but certainly not all - did not know any better than what they seemed to observe everyday: the sun appeared to be going around the earth through our skies. This belief could be expected from a 7<sup>th</sup> century Bedouin, but not from an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient creator.

What could this actually mean other than that the sun takes a path similar to that of the moon (which does indeed go around the earth once per month, and to an ancient person seems to do so on a nightly basis)? The word translated &quot;follow&quot; is used many other places to mean recite, but is primarily defined as to follow, go or walk behind, follow in way of imitation, of action etc., and is often used for animals like camels following behind each other.
