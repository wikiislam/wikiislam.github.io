<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>According to Muslim historians, Muhammad’s <i>Farewell Sermon</i> (خطبة الوداع‎, Khuṭbatu l-Wadā') was delivered on the ninth day of <i>Dhu al-Hijjah</i> (Month of Hajj- Pilgrimage 632 CE) in the valley of mount Arafat. This area located in <a href="wiki/Saudi_Arabia.html" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> was, and still is, considered holy and even today non-Muslims are forbidden from entering. 
</p><p>The sermon took place ten years after  Muhammad’s <i>Hijra</i> (هِجْرَة Migration) to <a href="wiki/Medina.html" title="Medina">Medina</a>, meaning it was after conquering Mecca and wiping the infidels from the land. 
</p><p>Before we begin our analysis of the Farewell Sermon, we must note that as an event, it took place following this <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'anic</a> <a href="wiki/Revelations.html" title="Revelations">revelation</a>: 
</p>
<div class="quotes"> O ye who believe! Truly the Mushrikuns (Pagans and all unbelievers) are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.028#009.028">9:28</a> </div></div>
<p>Accordingly, the listeners were all strictly Muslim. Muhammad was addressing his own people, since no others were allowed to enter the area of the Sacred Mosque, which includes the Plain of Arafat.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_of_The_Farewell_Sermon">Analysis of The Farewell Sermon</span></h2>
<p>Muhammad begins by praising and thanking his Lord, then addresses his followers.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Call_for_Jihad">The Call for Jihad</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">&quot;O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today&quot;.<br> </div> 
<p>&quot;Take these words to those who could not be present here today,&quot; An extremely significant statement, as it is symbolically calling for a full-scale <a href="wiki/Jihad.html" title="Jihad" class="mw-redirect">Jihad</a>. He accentuates the importance of taking his words to those who are not present there; naturally, by whatever means he has employed thus far to take down all those who had not paid heed to him and his message. Put simply, it meant: “wage Jihad by any means” 
</p>
<div class="quotes">O People, just as you regard this month, this day, and this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your lord, and that he will indeed reckon your deeds. Allah has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...”<br> </div>
<p>There is nothing noteworthy here, except the first few sentences which reaffirm the sacredness of the city and the period, purified from unbelievers. Confirming once again, that the audience was exclusively Muslim. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things<br> </div>
<p>Again, nothing unusual, as most preacher preaches against Satan. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Misogyny">Misogyny</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste<br> </div>
<p>The sermon suddenly sinks into misogyny. As the addressees were men, Muhammad reminds them of their rights over women, but (almost as an afterthought) adds that women too have rights over men. But these so-called rights of women are very much conditional. 
</p><p>If women abide by the rights given to men, only then do they deserve to be fed and clothed. As far as women's rights are concerned in this sermon, that is it. Men are also encouraged to be kind to their women so long as they stay quite and obedient, something akin to a pet (in the <a href="wiki/The_Farewell_Sermon.html" title="The Farewell Sermon">authentic account</a> of this sermon, Muhammad does indeed liken women to domestic animals).<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Analysis_of_Muhammads_Farewell_Sermon.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Women even have restrictions placed on their friendships with others (male or female) as proven by Muhammad commanding chastity from women separately. Therefore, even innocent friendships with other women is not possible if the husband wishes it. They are under their husbands will and can only enjoy what we would consider the basic rights of a women in a traditional marriage only if they remain in full compliance to their men. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">O People, listen to me in earnest, worship Allah, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.<br> </div>
<p>A mention of the <a href="wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam.html" title="Five Pillars of Islam">pillars of Islam</a>; Nothing of note.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Equality_of_Mankind">Equality of Mankind</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">&quot;All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves&quot;<br> </div>
<p>This is the most often quoted portion of the Farewell Sermon, used by Muslims to preach of their prophet’s commitment to humanity. The talk is harsh on Arab prejudice against non-Arabs. It would seem, we have some glossy words against racism. 
</p><p>In reality, Muhammad was talking of piety in religious affairs. In this faculty, there can be no supreme race or language. Muhammad was compelled to preach this, due to his earlier call for Jihad. His followers would no-doubt encounter many non-Arabs and people of differing races, so in tough times, these kinds of appeasements would be necessary. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Racial_Prejudice">Racial Prejudice</span></h4>
<p>On the other hand, Muhammad was very much prejudicial. For an example of this, we need only look to the following hadith where he hoists clannish supremacy: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Jabir bin Samura: 
I heard the Prophet saying, &quot;There will be twelve Muslim rulers (who will rule all the Islamic world).&quot; He then said a sentence which I did not hear. My father said, &quot;All of them (those rulers) will be from Quraish.&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/089-sbt.php#009.089.329#009.089.329">9:89:329</a></div></div>
<p>The <i>Quraish</i> (قريش‎ Qurayš) were Arabs and Muhammad (himself being from the Quraish tribe) was speaking of the rulers who would rise up after him to rule over the Islamic world. When Muhammad says &quot;will be&quot; the connotation to his followers was and still is &quot;should be&quot;. Moreover, this hadith has contributed a lot to the <a href="wiki/Shiite.html" title="Shiite">Shi'ite</a>-<a href="wiki/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> rift in the Muslim world.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Brotherhood_in_Islam">Brotherhood in Islam</span></h4>
<p>Next we tackle the meaning of &quot;brotherhood&quot; in Islam; Whenever Muhammad spoke of brotherhood, it was only of the brotherhood between fellow believers (Muslims) and here too it is no different. 
</p><p>Muhammad starts by proclaiming &quot;all mankind is from a common father and mother&quot;, but soon adds &quot;Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood.&quot; It could not be stated any clearer than that; Only Muslims are brothers to Muslims. There is no mention of Atheists, Idolaters or even the so-called <a href="wiki/Islam_and_the_People_of_the_Book.html" title="Islam and the People of the Book">People of the Book</a> who themselves are often equated with Idolaters. 
</p><p>Muhammad began his speech with the call for Jihad, so this has much significance. It was a call to stretch beyond their current dominion and for this purpose he alerts only those whom he considers part of the brotherhood. When the going gets tough, Muslims (and only Muslims) should conserve the brotherhood. We now move onto the final part of the sermon.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Termination_of_Prophethood">The Termination of Prophethood</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">&quot;Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone. O People, no prophet or apostle will be come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Quran and my example, the sunnah, and if you follow these you will never go astray. All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O Allah, that I have conveyed your message to your people&quot;.<br> </div>
<p>Muhammad reaffirms the termination of prophethood by saying &quot;no new faith will be born.&quot; Once again, &quot;will be born&quot; When spoken by Muhammad means &quot;should be born.&quot; 
</p><p>This speech took place after winning over the unbelievers of Mecca. He had already expelled the entirety of the Jewish population from the land, and cleansed his holy city of all unbelievers. Islam had finally won over existing faiths, and likewise there should be no other faiths in the future. Muslims must keep an eye out for new emergent faiths like the Bahá'ís and do that which is necessary to destroy them. And this is what Muslims push as Muhammad being at his most tolerant? 
</p><p>He continues by saying &quot;I leave behind me two things, the Qur'an and my example, the sunnah, and if you follow these you will never go astray&quot;. As with the beginning, he concludes the sermon with the reiteration for Jihad. &quot;All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again&quot; And by doing so, they have to follow Qur'an and Sunnah of the prophet. This takes us back to the Qur'an.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Meaning_of_Fitna">The Meaning of Fitna</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">And fight them on until there is no more <b>Fitna</b>, and it all becomes the religion of Allah altogether and everywhere; then if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/008-qmt.php#008.039#008.039">8:39</a> </div></div>
<p>The Arabic word <i>Fitna</i> (فِتْنَةٌ‎)  does not have the same meaning as given by our three official translators (Yusuf Ali, Picktall, Shakir), which is &quot;tumult&quot; and &quot;oppression&quot;. To understand the true meaning of this word as spoken by Muhammad, we need to look towards the universally accepted Qur'anic <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">commentary</a> by Ibn Kathir: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">&quot;Ibn `Umar came to us and was asked, &quot;What do you say about fighting during Fitnah<i> Ibn `Umar said, &quot;Do you know what Fitnah refers to Muhammad was fighting against the idolators, and at that time, attending (or residing with) the idolators was a Fitnah (trial in religion). </i>
Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah (And fight them until there is no more Fitnah...) &quot;So that there is no more Shirk.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=8&tid=20140?sid=8&tid=20140">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</a></div></div>
<p>It is plainly evident that the word &quot;Fitna&quot; denotes polytheism or anything un-Islamic.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Muhammad started his sermon, proclaiming the importance of conveying his message to those who were absent. Who are these absentees? There weren’t many Muslims absent. Ali had been called back from Yemen to partake in this pilgrimage. Moreover, Muhammad did not say anything new in this sermon to his Muslim followers. 
</p><p>Muhammad preached on (Strictly Muslim) brotherhood, then of the pillars of Islam, All of which had been already established. Five prayers a day, fasting, Zakat (giving alms), performing hajj; <a href="wiki/Jizyah.html" title="Jizyah">Jizyah</a> too was established by then.  There was no need to repeat any of this information to the well-informed Muslims. 
</p><p>Therefore, we can conclude that the absentees being referred to were in fact the non-Muslims of foreign lands. Muhammad was alerting his followers to convey the message of Islam to the absentees, who were yet to become Muslims. As has been mentioned previously, he signaled this in the introduction and conclusion of his speech. Convey this message to the absentees. 
</p><p>Muslim historians tell us what happened soon after this farewell sermon: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Then the apostle returned and stopped in Medina for the rest of Dhul Hijja, Muharram and Safar. He ordered the people to make an expedition to Syria and put over them Usama bin Zayd; his freed slave. He ordered him to lead his cavalry into the territory of the Balqa and Al-Darum in the land of Palestine. The men got ready and all the first emigrants went with Usama.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Ishaq: 970</div></div>
<p>An expedition to Syria, which is far <i>beyond</i> Mecca. So jihad had begun straight after Muhammad’s farewell speech. Muhammad sent messengers to distant kings including; Negus, Chosroes of Persia, and the Eastern Roman Emperor Heraclius, to whom he wrote: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">&quot;...I [Muhammad] invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe...&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/052-sbt.php#004.052.191#004.052.191">4:52:191</a></div></div> 
<p>He ordered his <a href="wiki/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">ummah</a> to take his message to the absentees, and the precedence in how to approach this task was set by Muhammad himself. &quot;Take these words to those who could not be present here today&quot;. Muhammad ordered it, and his followers complied by invading nation after nation in what is now referred to as the Arab or Muslim conquests. The message of Muhammad’s farewell sermon has to be understood under the context in which it was delivered, otherwise its true meaning is lost.  
</p><p>It is obvious that the sermon has been cut short while reporting. Additions may not have been made, but there were a lot of deletion for sure. The reason for believing this? These kinds of sermons are usually too lengthy, but this particular one, if accepted as genuine, is rather short. That’s why believing many parts of this sermon have been erased is by no means irrational.
