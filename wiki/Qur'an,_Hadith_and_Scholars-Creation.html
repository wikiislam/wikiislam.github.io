<div class="quotes">According to Ibn Humayd -Yahya b. Wadih -Yahya b. Ya'qub -Hammad -Sa'id b. Jubayr -Ibn 'Abbas: This world is one of the weeks of the other world-<b>seven thousand years</b>. Six thousand two hundred years have already passed. (The world) will surely experience hundreds of years, during which there will be no believer in the oneness of God there.
<p>Others said that the total extent of time is <b>six thousand years</b>.
</p><p><i>Those who said this</i>
</p><p>According to Abu Hisham -Mu'awiyah b. Hisham -Sufyan -al-A'mash -Abu Salih -Kab : This <b>world is six thousand years</b>.
</p>
According to Muhammad b. Sahl b. 'Askar -Ismail b. 'Abd al-Karim -'Abd al-Samad b. Ma'qil i -Wahb : Five thousand six hundred years of this world have elapsed. I do not know which kings and prophets lived in every period (zaman) of those years. I asked Wahb b. Munabbih: How long is (the total duration of) this world? He replied: <b>Six thousand years</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_I:_General_Introduction_and_From_the_Creation_to_the_Flood" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 1, pp. 172-173</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">All these facts taken together make it clear that of the two statements I have mentioned concerning the total extent of time, the one from Ibn 'Abbas, and the other from Kab, the one more likely to be correct in accordance with the information coming from the Messenger of God is that of Ibn 'Abbas transmitted here by us on his authority: <b>The world is one of the weeks of the other world-seven thousand years</b>.'
<p>Consequently, because this is so and <b>the report on the authority of the Messenger of God is sound</b>-namely, that he reported that what remained of the time of this world during his life was half a day, or five hundred years, since five hundred years are half a day of the days, of which one is a thousand years-the conclusion is that <b>the time of this world that had elapsed to the moment of the Prophet's statement corresponds to what we have transmitted on the authority of Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani from the Prophet, and is 6,500 years or approximately 6,500 years</b>. God knows best!
</p>
Our statement about the duration of the periods (azman) of this world from its very beginning to its very end <b>is the most firmly established of all the statements we have</b>, on account of the testimony to its soundness as explained by us. Information has (also) been transmitted on the authority of the Messenger of God to prove the soundness of the statement that<b> all of this world is six thousand years</b>. If its chain of transmitters were sound, we would have to go no further. It is Muhammad b. Sinan al-Qazzaz'43 -'Abd al-Samad b. 'Abd al-Warithf -Zabban -'Asim' -Abu Salih-Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of God said: AI-hugb is eighty years. The day of them is one-sixth of this world.&quot;&quot; According to this tradition, it is clear that <b>all of this world is six thousand years</b>. That is because, if one day of the other world equals one thousand years and a single such day is one-sixth of this world, the conclusion would be that the total is six of the days of the other world, and that is <b>six thousand years</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_I:_General_Introduction_and_From_the_Creation_to_the_Flood" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 1, pp. 183-184</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Now then, this being so, there is [also] <b>a sound tradition from the Messenger of God</b> told us by Hannad b. al-Sari, who also said that he read all of the hadith (to Abu Bakr)'&quot; -Abu Bakr b. 'Ayyash-Abu Sad al-Baggal -'Ikrimah Ibn 'Abbas: The Jews came to the Prophet and asked him about the creation of the heavens and the earth. He said: God created the earth on Sunday and Monday. He created the mountains and the uses they possess on Tuesday. <b>On Wednesday, He created trees, water, cities and the cultivated and barren land</b>. These are four (days). He continued (citing the Qur'an): &quot;Say: Do you really not believe in the One Who created the earth in two days, and set up others like Him? That is the Lord of the worlds. He made in it firmly anchored (mountains) above it and blessed it and decreed that it contain the amount of food it provides, (all) in four days, equally for those asking -for those who ask. He continued: <b>On Thursday, He created heaven. On Friday, He created the stars, the sun, the moon, and the angels, until three hours remained</b>. In the first of these three hours, He created the terms (of human life), who would live and who would die. In the second , He cast harm upon everything that is useful for mankind. And in the third, (He created) Adam and had him dwell in Paradise. He commanded Iblis to prostrate himself before Adam, and He drove Adam out of Paradise at the end of the hour.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_I:_General_Introduction_and_From_the_Creation_to_the_Flood" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 1, pp. 187-188</a></div></div>

<p>'Ali al-Suda'i -Hajjaj -Ibn Jurayj -Isma'il b. Umayyah-Ayyub b. Khalid -'Abdallah b. Rafi', the mawla of Umm Salamah -Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of God took me by the hand. Then he said: <b>God created the soil on Saturday. Upon it, He created the mountains on Sunday. He created the trees on Monday. He created evil on Tuesday. He created light on Wednesday. He scattered the animals on the earth on Thursday, and He created Adam as the last of His creatures after (the time of) the afternoon prayer in the last hour of Friday</b>, in the time between the afternoon prayer and night(fall).&quot;'
</p><p>According to Muhammad b. 'Abdallah b. Bazi'-al-Fudayl b. Sulayman-Muhammad b. Zayd176 -Abu Salamah b. 'Abd al- Rahman b. 'Awf -Ibn Salam and Abu Hurayrah who mentioned the hour (of Adam's creation) on Friday on the authority of the Prophet as he stated it. 'Abdallih b. Salim said: I know which hour it is. <b>God began the creation of the heavens and the earth on Sunday, and He finished in the last hour of Friday</b>. Thus, it is the last hour of Friday (in which Adam was created). 
</p><p>According to al-Muthanna -al-Hajjaj-Hammid -'Ata' b. al-Sa'ib -'Ikrimah: The Jews asked the Prophet: What about Sunday? The Messenger of God replied: On it, <b>God created the earth and spread it out. They asked about Monday, and he replied: On it, He created Adam. They asked about Tuesday, and he replied: On it, He created the mountains, water, and so on. They asked about Wednesday, and he replied: Food. They asked about Thursday, and he replied: He created the heavens. They asked about Friday, and he replied: God created night and day</b>. Then, when they asked about Saturday and mentioned God's rest(ing on it), he exclaimed : God be praised! God then revealed: &quot;We have created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, and fatigue did not touch Us.&quot;
</p>
<b>The two reports transmitted by us from the Messenger of God have made it clear that the sun and the moon were created after God had created many things of His creation</b>. That is because the <b>hadith of Ibn 'Abbas on the authority of the Messenger of God</b> indicates that God created the sun and the moon on Friday. If this is so, earth and heaven and what is in them, except the angels and Adam, had been created before God created the sun and the moon. All this (thus) existed while there was no light and no day, since night and day are but nouns designating hours known through the traversal by the sun and the moon of the course of the sphere. Now, if it is correct that the earth and the heaven and what is between them, except what we have mentioned, were in existence when there was no sun and no moon, the conclusion is that all that existed when there was no night and no day. The same (conclusion results from) the following <b>hadith of Abu Hurayrah reported on the authority of the Messenger of God: God created light on Wednesday-meaning by &quot;light&quot; the sun, if God wills</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_I:_General_Introduction_and_From_the_Creation_to_the_Flood" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 1, pp. 189-191</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">God forbade Adam and Eve to eat from one tree in Paradise, but (otherwise) they could freely eat of its plenty wherever they wished. Satan came and entered inside the snake.

<div class="quotes">Satan whispered to Eve about the tree and succeeded in taking her to it; then he made it seem good to Adam. He continued. When Adam felt a need for her and called her, she said: No! unless you go there. When he went, she said again: No! unless you eat from this tree. He continued. They both ate from it, and their secret parts became apparent to them. He continued. Adam then went about in Paradise in flight. His Lord called out to him: Adam, is it from Me that you are fleeing? Adam replied: No, my Lord, but I feel shame before You. <b>When God asked what had caused his trouble, he replied: Eve, my Lord. Whereupon God said: Now it is My obligation to make her bleed once every month, as she made this tree bleed. I also must make her stupid, although I created her intelligent (halimah), and must make her suffer pregnancy and birth with difficulty, although I made it easy for her to be pregnant and give birth. Ibn Zayd continued: Were it not for the affliction that affected Eve, the women of this world would not menstruate, and they would be intelligent and, when pregnant, give birth easily</b>.
<p>According to Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq- Yazid b. 'Abdallah b. Qusayt -Sa'id b. al-Musayyab: I heard him swear by God unequivocally: <b>As long as Adam was in his right mind, he did not eat from the tree. Eve, however, gave him wine to drink, and when he was drunk, she led him to the tree, and he ate from it.</b>
</p><p>When Adam and Eve committed the sin (of eating from the forbidden tree), God drove them out of Paradise and deprived them of the luxury and generous plenty they had enjoyed. He threw them, their enemy Iblis, and the snake down to earth. The Lord said to them: &quot;Fall down being one another's enemy!,

<div class="quotes">This Ayah (2:29) is explained in detail in Surat As-Sajdah where Allah said;
<p><i>(Say (O Muhammad ): &quot;Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days And you set up rivals (in worship) with Him That is the Lord of all that exists. He placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers) in four Days equal (i.e. all these four `days' were equal in the length of time) for all those who ask (about its creation). Then He Istawa ila the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: &quot;Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.&quot; They both said: &quot;We come willingly.&quot; Then He finished them (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard (from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils). Such is the decree of the Almighty, the Knower) (41:9-12).</i>
</p><p>These Ayat indicate that <b>Allah started creation by creating earth, then He made heaven into seven heavens. This is how building usually starts, with the lower floors first and then the top floors</b>, as the scholars of Tafsir reiterated, as we will come to know, Allah willing. Allah also said,
</p><p><i>(Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed He raised its height, and has perfected it.

<div class="quotes">Sahih Al-Bukhari records that when Ibn `Abbas was question about this matter, he said that <b>the earth was created before heaven</b>, and the earth was spread out only after the creation of the heaven. Several Tafsir scholars of old and recent times also said similarly, as we have elaborated on in the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at (chapter 79). The result of that discussion is that the word Daha (translated above as &quot;spread&quot;) is mentioned and explained in Allah's statement,
<p><i>(And the earth, after that, He spread it out. And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. And the mountains He has fixed firmly.) (79:30-32)</i>
</p>
Therefore, Daha means that the earth's treasures were brought to its surface after finishing the job of creating whatever will reside on earth and heaven. When the earth became Daha, the water burst out to its surface and the various types, colors, shapes and kinds of plants grew. <b>The stars started rotating along with the planets that rotate around them</b>.

<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i>
<p>There are people who say that long ago man was a monkey and he evolved. Is this true? Is there any evidence?. 
</p><p><i>Answer:</i>
</p><p>Praise be to Allaah.   
</p><p><b>This view is not correct, and the evidence for that is that Allaah has described in the Qur’aan the stages of the creation of Adam</b>. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was”
</p><p>[Aal ‘Imraan 3:59] 
</p><p><b>This dust was moistened until it became sticky mud or clay that stuck to the hands.</b> Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth)”
</p><p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:12] 
</p><p>“Verily, We created them of a sticky clay”
</p><p>[al-Saaffaat 37:12] 
</p><p><b>Then it became dried (sounding) clay of altered mud.</b> Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud”
</p><p>[al-Hijr 15:26] 
</p><p><b>Then when it dried it became sounding clay like the clay of pottery.</b> Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery”
</p><p>[al-Rahmaan 55:14] 
</p><p><b>Then Allaah moulded it into the form that He wanted and breathed into him (his) soul created by Him.</b> Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay’.
</p><p>So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him”
</p><p>[Saad 38:71-72] 
</p><p>These are the stages through which the creation of Adam passed according to the Qur’aan. As for the stages of creation which the progeny of Adam pass through, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).
</p><p>Thereafter We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).
</p><p>Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allaah, the Best of creators”
</p><p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:12-14] 
</p><p><b>With regard to the wife of Adam – Hawwa’ (Eve) – Allaah tells us that He created her from him</b>, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women”

<div class="quotes">Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
<p>It was narrated concerning them, as quoted by more than one of the earlier and later scholars, that <b>Allah prescribed that Adam (peace be upon him) should marry his daughters to his sons as a matter of necessity</b>. But they said: A male and female were born from each pregnancy, so he would marry the female from one pregnancy to the male from another. The sister of Habeel was ugly and the sister of Qabeel was beautiful. Qabeel wanted to keep her for himself and not give her to his brother, but Adam insisted that they should offer sacrifices and whichever brother’s sacrifice was accepted by Allah would win her hand. So they offered sacrifices and it was accepted from Habeel but it was not accepted from Qabeel. And their story was told by Allah in His Book. End quote. 
</p><p>Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/82 
</p><p>Ibn Abi Haatim narrated: <b>It was forbidden for a woman to marry her twin brother, and he was commanded to give her in marriage to a brother from another pregnancy. And from each pregnancy one boy and one girl were born.</b> Whilst they were like that, a beautiful girl was born to him, and another was born who was ugly. The twin brother of the ugly one said to his brother: Give me your twin sister in marriage and I will give you my twon sister in marriage. He said: I have more right to my twin sister. So they offered sacrifices, and the sacrifice of the one who offered a ram was accepted but the sacrifice of the one who offered crops was not accepted, so he killed him. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its isnaad is jayyid.

</p><p>As <b>this is proven from the Sahaabah</b> (may Allah be pleased with them) or some of them, especially from Ibn ‘Abbaas who was the most knowledgeable of people in the interpretation of the Qur’aan, and the scholars narrated what he mentioned, <b>this is not regarded as speculation</b> that it is not permissible to accept.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Al-Fawzan">Al-Fawzan</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">The Prophet <b>Muhammad said about women: &quot;I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you</b>. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you,&quot; and so on. This hadith and others like it were misunderstood by the ignorant. Corrupt people interpreted it in a way that differs from its original intent. Because of their ignorance, their insolence, their stupidity, and because of their enmity towards Islam and Muslims, they turned this hadith into evidence that Islam disgraces women, diminishing her value, and describes her in inadequate terms.<br>. . .<br>
<p>These hadiths provide some of the most decisive evidence that Islam protects women and guarantees their rights. Islam has surrounded the woman with a fence of compassion and mercy. <b>It has shown that the twisted nature of women stems from their very creation. This is how Allah wanted woman to be.</b> Therefore, the husband must adapt himself to her and be patient with her. He should not giver her too many things to do, or things that she is incapable of doing. <b>He should not make her do anything that is contrary to her nature, and to the way she was created by Allah</b>. In addition, <b>he should turn a blind eye to her mistakes, he should tolerate her slips and errors, and put up with all the silly ignorant things she might say, because this constitutes part of the nature of her creation</b>. In addition, women have surging emotions, which in some cases, might overpower their minds. The weakness with which women were created is the secret behind their attractiveness and appeal to their husbands. It is the source of women's seduction of men, and one of the elements strengthening the bond between husband and wife. This is one of the wondrous miracles of Allah: The strength of a woman lies in her weakness. Her power of seduction and appeal lie in her emotions, which might overpower her mind at times.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
Both husband and wife should satisfy their spouse's natural urges, and should try to gratify their desires, as long as nothing prevents this. This is why the Prophet said: &quot;When a man calls his wife to fulfill his needs, she must go to him, even if she is busy with the oven.&quot; Imagine this: There is fire in the oven, and she wants to bake bread. But even if she's busy with this work that cannot be neglected, when he calls her, she must leave the oven and go to her husband. Another hadith says: &quot;She must go to him, even if she is on the back of a camel.&quot; She must go to him, even if she is riding.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.memri.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/350/1483.htm">Husbands Should Put Up with Their Wives' Slips and Errors, Because the Twisted Nature of Women Stems from Their Very Creation</a><br>MEMRI TV, Clip No. 1483, Broadcast: June 11, 2007</div></div>
