<div class="quotes">Christopher Leggett, 39, was killed Tuesday morning (June 23) in front of the language and computer school he operated in Nouakchott, the capital city. 
<p>Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, North African unit of the al-Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the murder on an Internet site, accusing Leggett of “missionary activities.” A North African al-Qaeda spokesman aired a statement on an Arab TV station saying the group killed Leggett because he was allegedly trying to convert Muslims to Christianity. 
</p><p>Advocacy organization Middle East Concern reported that Leggett “resisted what appeared to be an attempt to kidnap him and was then shot in the head several times by his two assailants.” 
</p><p>His family issued a statement today saying they forgave the murderers but asked that they be caught and prosecuted. 
</p><p>“In a spirit of love, we express our forgiveness for those who took away the life of our remarkable son,” the family said in the statement, distributed in English, French and Arabic. “Chris had a deep love for Mauritania and its people, a love that we share. Despite this terrible event, we harbor no ill will for the Mauritanian people. On a spiritual level, we forgive those responsible, asking only that justice be applied against those who killed our son.” 
</p><p>Mauritania’s minister of justice reportedly said that Leggett’s death “was a great loss to Mauritania.” Leggett, his wife and four children lived for seven years in Mauritania, where he directed an aid agency that provided training in computer skills, sewing and literacy, and he also ran a micro-finance program, according to the Cleveland Daily Banner. 
</p><p>Mauritania’s National Foundation for the Defence of Democracy (FNDD) called for the killers to be brought to justice.

“This hateful crime, which was committed in broad daylight close to the market in El Ksar, one of the busiest in Nouakchott, once again raises the issue of instability and terrorism, which is often used by the military authorities to justify all sorts of unnatural situations,” the FNDD the statement read.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2009/06-June/newsarticle_5984.html/&date=2013-05-10?url=http://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2009/06-June/newsarticle_5984.html/&date=2013-05-10">Islamic Extremists Kill U.S. Aid Worker</a><br>World Watch Monitor, June 30, 2009</div></div>
<div class="quotes">As funeral services were held in Tennessee for Christian aid worker Christopher Leggett yesterday, tensions remained high for Christians in the capital of Mauritania, where he was slain last week.
<p>A Christian worker who works in the capital city of Nouakchott told Compass that following the street assassination of Leggett by an al-Qaeda linked group the morning of June 23, the danger level in the city has forced him and his team to temporarily relocate to a European country.
</p><p>“After the crime various believers were arrested, and the community of workers is going through very tense moments because of another threat by al-Qaeda and the lack of security in the country,” said the Christian, who requested anonymity. “Our leaders have asked us to leave the country for a while, as the government had sent a security force of 10 policemen to guard our home 24 hours a day. Our mobility was limited, and we left the country under police escort to the airport.”
</p><p>Leggett was shot in a crowded market area in front of the language and computer school he operated in Nouakchott. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African unit of the al-Qaeda terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the murder on an Internet site, accusing Leggett of “missionary activities.” A North African al-Qaeda spokesman aired a statement on an Arab TV station saying the group killed Leggett because he was allegedly trying to convert Muslims to Christianity.
</p><p>At least two gunmen approached Leggett in broad daylight, stunning local people unaccustomed to such brazen attacks.
</p><p>“It’s a very crowded area, and it was in the morning in the midst of many people,” the Christian worker told Compass. “Apparently they wanted to kidnap him, and as they were not able, they then shot him three times in the head and he died.”
</p><p>More than 1,000 mourners, including many from outside the United States, reportedly attended Leggett’s funeral in Cleveland, Tenn., where he grew up. Husband and father of four children ages 15, 13, 12 and 8, Leggett taught at a center specializing in computer science and languages in El Kasr, a lower-class neighborhood in Nouakchott.  Leggett, his wife Jackie and their children had lived in Mauritania for more than six years.

<div class="quotes">The 2009 Nouakchott suicide bombing occurred in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, on August 8, 2009, outside the embassy of France. It was the first instance of a suicide bombing in the history of Mauritania. The bombing killed the perpetrator and wounded three people.
<p>The attack occurred three weeks after Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz had claimed victory in the contested 2009 Mauritanian presidential election. His inauguration took place on August 5, 2009, just three days before the Nouakchott bombing.
</p><p>Mauritania has witnessed a series of terrorist attacks against Western interests in recent years. Four French tourists were kidnapped and murdered in 2007. On June 23, 2009, an American teacher, Christopher Logest, was shot and killed in an attack in Nouakchott. The terrorist group, Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), claimed responsibility for both attacks.
</p><p>The attacker, a young man, was reportedly wearing a boubou, a traditional men's garment common in Mauritania and other regions of West Africa. The bomber wore an explosive belt.
The man blew himself up on the sidewalk between the French embassy and the Embassy of Libya at approximately 7:00 pm local time. While both embassies were near the suicide bombing, the target was clearly the French embassy. The explosion did not damage the French embassy.
Two employees of the French embassy, who were identified as paramilitary gendarmes, were jogging nearby at the time of the attack. Both were hospitalized overnight with minor injuries. One other person was slightly injured in the attack. The detonations marked the first time that a suicide bombing had taken place in Mauritania.
</p><p>The government of France announced an investigation of the terrorist attack. The French government issued a statement promising to support Mauritanian authorities during the inquiry.
</p>
The Mauritanian police identified the suicide bomber as a Mauritanian man born in 1987. Authorities stated that the perpetrator had been &quot;formally identified as a member of the Jihadist movement.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nouakchott_suicide_bombing&date=2013-05-10?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Nouakchott_suicide_bombing&date=2013-05-10">2009 Nouakchott suicide bombing</a><br>Wikipedia, accessed May 10, 2013</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Three Spanish volunteer aid workers were kidnapped by gunmen while delivering supplies to impoverished villages in Mauritania, and Spain's interior minister said Monday he suspected al-Qaida-linked Islamists.
<p>Two men and a woman were kidnapped in the West African country, according to Julia Tabernejo, a spokeswoman for Barcelona-based aid group Barcelona Accion Solidaria. The three were in a 4-wheel drive vehicle at the very back end of a convoy when the attack happened Sunday.
</p><p>&quot;I think the others heard shooting, and when they stopped, the car was empty,&quot; she said. &quot;Those three were no longer in it.&quot;
</p><p>She identified the aid workers as Albert Vilalta, Roque Pascual and Alicia Gamez. The two men are businessmen and are about 50 years old. She said Gamez is a civil servant in the court system.
</p><p>A Spanish foreign ministry official said the aid workers were abducted Sunday while traveling in a convoy of 13 vehicles. The kidnapping occurred after two of the vehicles became separated from the convoy for unknown reasons, according to the official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with ministry rules.
</p><p>A ministry statement said Mauritanian forces are now accompanying the rest of the convoy at Spain's request.
</p><p>Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters on Monday that he feared the kidnapping was the work of extremists.
</p><p>&quot;All signs are that it is a kidnapping,&quot; he said in Brussels as he entered a meeting with European Union officials. &quot;If that is the case, as I fear it is, everything suggests it is a kidnapping by AQMI, which is al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa. It would not be the first kidnapping it has carried out in that area of European or American aid workers.&quot;
</p><p>Mauritania, once known as a predominantly moderate Muslim nation on Africa's western coast, has been rocked by attacks by the North African al-Qaida group.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
Elsewhere in West Africa, the group also has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of two U.N. staffers in December, and the kidnapping of four European tourists a month later. One of the four Europeans, a Briton, was killed by his captors. The U.N. staffers and the other tourists were released.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=78105257&date=2013-00-00?url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=78105257&date=2013-00-00">3 aid workers kidnapped in Mauritania, Spanish minister suspects al-Qaida-linked militants</a><br>Ahmed Mohammed, Associated Press, November 30, 2009</div></div>
