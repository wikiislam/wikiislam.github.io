<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Concerns_over_Muslim_immigration_no_longer_.22right-wing.22">Concerns over Muslim immigration no longer &quot;right-wing&quot;</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">A new opinion survey shows that more than half of all Europeans believe there are too many immigrants in their countries and that immigration is having a negative impact on their lives.
<p>The findings – which come as Europeans are waking up to the consequences of decades of mass immigration from Muslim countries – point to a growing disconnect between European voters and their political masters regarding multicultural policies that encourage Muslim immigrants to remain segregated rather than become integrated into their host nations.
</p><p>The survey results mirror the findings of dozens of other recent polls. Taken together, they provide ample empirical evidence that scepticism about Muslim immigration is not limited to a &quot;right-wing&quot; political fringe, as proponents of multiculturalism often assert. Mainstream voters across the entire political spectrum are now expressing concerns about the role of Islam in Europe.
</p><p>The &quot;Global Views on Immigration&quot; survey was conducted by the London-based Ipsos global research firm and published on August 4. It polled citizens in nine European countries: Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden.
</p><p>The poll shows a close correlation between the views the natives of a given country have about immigration and the number of, and level of, integration of Muslim immigrants in their countries.
</p><p>For example, the poll finds that Belgians and Britons hold the most negative views on immigration; these countries also have some of the least integrated Muslim populations in Europe. The poll also shows that among Europeans, Poles have the most positive views on immigration and immigrants; Poland happens to have Europe's smallest Muslim community, which comprises less than 0.1% of that country's total population.
</p><p>The Ipsos poll shows that as a whole, more than 56% of Europeans believe &quot;there are too many immigrants&quot; in their countries: Belgium (72%), Britain (71%), Italy (67%), Spain (67%), Germany (53%), France (52%), Hungary (50%), Sweden (46%) and Poland (29%).
</p><p>In response to the polling question &quot;Would you say that immigration has generally had a positive or negative impact?&quot; majorities in all European countries except for Sweden and Poland say the impact has been negative: Belgium (72%), Britain (64%), Italy (56%), Spain (55%), France (54%), Germany (54%), Hungary (52%), Sweden (37%) and Poland (32%). As a whole, only 17.5% of Europeans say immigration has been positive.
</p><p>Most Europeans also agree with the survey statement &quot;Immigration has placed too much pressure on public services&quot; in their country: Britain (76%), Spain (70%), Belgium (68%), Hungary (59%), Germany (58%), France (56%), Italy (56%), Sweden (40%) and Poland (27%).
</p><p>The Ipsos survey mirrors the findings of a number of other recent polls which show that Europe's mainstream political parties are losing touch with public opinion on the issue of Muslim immigration.
</p><p>A new report &quot;Muslim-Western Tensions Persist&quot; was published by the Washington, DC-based Pew Research Center on July 21. It shows that Europeans believe their relations with Muslims are bad: France (62%), Germany (61%), Spain (58%) and Britain (52%).
</p><p>The poll also shows that most Europeans believe Muslims in their countries do not want to integrate: Germany (72%), Spain (69%), France (54%) and Britain (52%).
</p><p>The Pew survey shows that almost 60% of Europeans believe Muslims are &quot;fanatical,&quot; 50% believe they are &quot;violent&quot; and only 22% believe they are &quot;respectful of women.&quot; In response to the question &quot;Which religion is most violent?&quot; 90% of French say Islam, as do 87% of Spaniards, 79% of Germans and 75% of Britons. The poll also shows that more than two-thirds of Germans (73%), Britons (70%), French (68%) and Spanish (61%) are worried about Islamic extremists in their countries.
</p><p>A separate poll conducted by the Pew Global Attitudes Project shows widespread support in Europe for banning Islamic veils in public, including in schools, hospitals and government offices. The survey shows that 82% of French, 71% of Germans, 62% of Britons and 59% of Spaniards support such a ban.
</p><p>Another pan-European survey, the &quot;Guardian Euro Poll,&quot; shows that concern about Muslim immigration is widespread and not just limited to the political far right. The poll shows that although 62% of Europeans view themselves as &quot;liberal&quot; rather than &quot;traditional&quot; on social issues, pluralities in the four biggest countries (Britain, France, Germany and Spain) are opposed to immigration from outside the European Union. The survey also shows that unrestricted immigration is the first- or second-most serious problem a large number of Europeans face.
</p><p>In Britain, a poll called the &quot;Searchlight Fear and Hope Survey&quot; shows that huge numbers of Britons would support an anti-immigration English nationalist party if it were not associated with violence and fascist imagery. The poll, conducted by London-based Populus, also shows that more than 50% of Britons agree with the proposition that &quot;Muslims create problems in the UK.&quot;
</p><p>In France, an Ifop poll published by the center-left Le Monde newspaper shows that 42% of French citizens consider the presence of a Muslim community in their country to be &quot;a threat&quot; to their national identity. Moreover, 68% of French say Muslims are &quot;not well integrated in society.&quot; Out of these, 61% of the French blame this failure on the &quot;refusal&quot; by Muslims to integrate.
</p><p>Recent polls also show that up to two-thirds of French voters believe that &quot;multiculturalism&quot; and the integration of Muslims into society have failed. A survey by Ifop for the France-Soir newspaper shows that nearly 40% of French voters believe that Muslim prayer in the streets of France resembles an occupation. An opinion poll published by Le Parisien newspaper shows that voters view Marine Le Pen, who leads the far right National Front party, as the candidate best suited to fix the problem of Muslim immigration.
</p><p>In Germany, an opinion survey, &quot;Perception and Acceptance of Religious Diversity,&quot; conducted by the sociology department of the University of Münster, in partnership with the prestigious TNS Emnid political polling firm, shows that the majority of Germans disagree with a statement by German President Christian Wulff that Islam &quot;belongs in Germany.&quot;
</p><p>The study shows that only 34% of West Germans and 26% of East Germans have a positive view of Muslims. Fewer than 5% of Germans think Islam is a tolerant religion, and only 30% say they approve of the building of mosques. The number of Germans who approve of the building of minarets or the introduction of Muslim holidays is even lower.
</p><p>Fewer than 10% of West Germans and 5% of East Germans say that Islam is a peaceful religion. More than 40% of Germans believe that the practice of Islam should be vigorously restricted.
</p><p>Only 20% of Germans and 30% of French believe that Islam is suitable for the Western world. Significantly, more than 80% of those surveyed in Germany, France, Denmark, Portugal and the Netherlands agree with the statement &quot;that Muslims must adapt to our culture.&quot;
</p><p>In the Netherlands, polls show that an overwhelming majority of Dutch voters are sceptical about multiculturalism. According to a Maurice de Hond poll published by the center-right newspaper Trouw on June 19, 74% of Dutch voters say immigrants should conform to Dutch values. Moreover, 83% of those polled say they support a ban on Islamic burqas in public spaces.
</p><p>A separate Maurice de Hond poll published by the popular NU.nl news website on July 29 shows that 63% of Dutch are &quot;worried about the fact that the influence of Islam in Western European countries is increasing.&quot;
</p><p>Not surprisingly, the center-right government in Holland recently announced plans to abandon the long-standing model of multiculturalism that has encouraged Muslim immigrants to create a parallel society within the country.
</p><p>In Denmark, a Gallup/Berlingske poll recently published by the center-right Berlingske newspaper shows that 92% of Danish citizens believe Muslim immigrants should &quot;predominantly adopt local Danish customs.&quot;
</p><p>The poll was conducted after the new integration minister, Søren Pind, publicly rejected the idea that Denmark should be a multicultural society. According to Pind, Denmark should welcome foreigners who are willing to adopt and respect Danish values, norms and traditions; those who do not should not be in Denmark at all. &quot;The way I see it, when you choose Denmark, you choose Denmark because you want to become Danish,&quot; Pind said.
</p><p>Considered as a whole, the recent surveys show that majorities of Europeans are now worried about the impact that Muslim immigration is having on their daily lives.
</p>
But an arguably more important conclusion to be gleaned from the polling data is that ordinary Europeans are becoming increasingly willing to express their opinions in public.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">August 2011</div></div>

<div class="quotes">The latest polling from the Pew Research Center's Global Attitude Project shows that in Egypt, the US has a 20 per cent favorability rating, seven points below where it was in 2009, The Washington Post reports.
<p>In Pakistan, US approval is 11 per cent, a five-point drop since the Cairo speech, while in Jordan and Turkey, two important regional allies, American approval is 13 per cent (down 12 points) and 11 per cent (down four points) respectively.
</p><p><b>These surveys were conducted before the flap over charges of violating Pakistan's sovereignty in taking down Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden</b>.
</p><p>In no country surveyed did a majority approve of Obama's calls for political change, yet support for democracy is high in the region, the paper's editorial said.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
According to the editorial, instead of pandering, Obama should actively champion American notions of freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">May 2011</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Two years after US President Barack Obama called in a groundbreaking speech from Cairo for a &quot;new beginning&quot; in relations with the Muslim world, his popularity among Arabs has nosedived, a poll released Wednesday shows.
<p>An overwhelming majority of more than 4,000 people surveyed in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, told the Arab American Institute that they felt that Obama had not met the expectations he laid out in the June 2009 Cairo speech, the poll found.<br>. . .<br>
<b>The Arab world's image of the US as a whole has also soured to become even less favorable than during the last year of the administration of president George W. Bush</b>, under whom the United States led an international coalition that invaded Iraq, the survey found.
</p><p>The killing by US Navy SEALs of Osama bin Laden did little to improve Arabs' views of the United States. <b>Majorities in all six countries said they viewed the United States less favorably following the killing of the Al-Qaeda head in Pakistan</b>.
</p><p>The highest favorability rating the United States got in the survey was from Saudi Arabia, where 30 percent of those polled said they saw the United States in a good light.
</p><p>The lowest rating came from Egypt -- a mere five percent.
</p><p>In order to improve relations with the Arab world, the United States should &quot;resolve the Palestinian issue,&quot; majorities said in Egypt, Jordan and Morocco.
</p><p>The Lebanese were split between resolving the Palestinian issue and ending the war in Iraq, while a majority of Saudis thought relations would improve if the United States were successful in stopping Iran's nuclear program.
</p><p>The survey was commissioned after Obama gave a speech on May 19, backing pro-democracy movements in the Arab world.
</p><p><b>A majority of poll respondents in all six countries except the Emirates said the situation in their country had worsened or not changed at all as a result of the Arab uprisings</b>.
</p>
In Egypt, where protesters succeeded after weeks of massive demonstrations in ending decades of rule by Hosni Mubarak, 16 percent said things were worse and 35 percent said they noticed no impact at all after the uprising.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">July 2011</div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="About_68_percent_of_Saudi_investors_are_corrupt">About 68 percent of Saudi investors are corrupt</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Nearly 68 per cent of Saudi investors resort to corrupt ways to promote their businesses while government bureaucracy remains a key obstacle to investment in the world’s dominant oil power.
<p>The findings were included in a report released at the Riyadh Economic Forum this week and was published by Aleqtisadia newspaper, which also said nearly 56 per cent of local investors believe the commercial arbitration system in the Gulf Kingdom is weak.
</p><p>Respondents who believe government bureaucracy is a main hurdle to investment increased by 13 per cent to 62 pr cent over the previous survey in 2005. The number of respondents who see public utilities as another obstacle increased by 34 per cent to 65 per cent.
</p><p>“<b>The study showed that 68 per cent of investors in Saudi Arabia resort to irregular methods to facilitate their businesses, including bribery, nepotism and fraud</b>,” the Arabic language daily said.
</p>
“The number of those who believe the attitude of government employees poses a real obstacle to investment also increased by nearly 25 per cent to 64 per cent…five years after the creation of industrial cities in the country, the degree of implementation has remained modest while economies cities have yet to produce concrete results.”<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">December 2011</div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Seven_of_the_top_ten_.27World.E2.80.99s_Most_Influential_Muslims.27_are_.22Islamists.22">Seven of the top ten 'World’s Most Influential Muslims' are &quot;Islamists&quot;</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre has released this year’s list of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.themuslim500.com/">500 “world’s most influential Muslims”</a> and of the top 10, seven are Islamists. The unfortunate reality is that Islamism is indeed mainstream thought in the Muslim world and non-Muslims have a lot of ground to make up in the struggle over the direction of the Muslim world.
<p>The most influential Muslim is Saudi King Abdullah. He is hailed as a reformer but that is by Saudi standards. Under his rule, Sharia is still the law of the land in an especially puritanical form.<br>. . .<br>
In second place is Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan. He has sharply moved the secular, pro-Western country of Turkey in an Islamist direction, expertly using the doctrine of &quot;<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.11234/pub_detail.asp">gradualism</a>.&quot;<br>. . .<br>
The Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie, who essentially declared jihad on the U.S. and pro-Western Arab governments in 2010, is in fourth place. This makes the Muslim Brotherhood the strongest international movement in the Islamic world.<br>. . .<br>
Fifth place went to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani. He does not preside over an Islamic state, but his government is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.radicalislam.org/analysis/qatar-us-ally-think-again">subsidizing</a> the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood while enjoying the status of a U.S. ally.  His country is home to Sheikh Qaradawi and Al-Jazeera. A 2009 State Department memo said that Qatar’s counter-terrorism cooperation is “considered the worst in the region.”<br>. . .<br>
Following Qatar is Iran, specifically Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Not much needs to be said about the threat posed by his influence.<br>. . .<br>
In eight place is Sheikh Ahmad Muhammad Al-Tayyeb, president of Al-Azhar University in Egypt. This is the most powerful Sunni religious institution, which endorsed Umdat al-Salik’s Reliance of the Traveler that teaches Muslims the ins and outs of Sharia Law. Al-Tayyeb calls for international laws against “defamation” of religion, a nicer sounding way of outlawing criticism of Islam. The draft constitution of Egypt approved by the Islamists requires that the government consult with Al-Azhar scholars on “matters related to Sharia.”
</p><p>Finishing off the top ten is Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Islamist who lives in Pennsylvania. His charter school network in America, the largest in the country, is under <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.radicalislam.org/analysis/fbi-investigates-islamist-charter-school-network">FBI investigation</a>. His influence has been <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/world/middleeast/turkey-feels-sway-of-fethullah-gulen-a-reclusive-cleric.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0?pagewanted=all&_r=0">instrumental</a> in spreading Islamism in Turkey. Although his preaching is on the less extreme end of Islamism, he has made <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.meforum.org/2045/fethullah-gulens-grand-ambition">multiple worrisome statements</a>.<br>. . .<br>
The three non-Islamists that made the top ten are King Mohammed VI of Morocco in third place, King Abdullah II of Jordan in seventh place and Indonesian President Yudhoyono in ninth.
</p>
Yudhoyono is not an Islamist but he has brought Islamists <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/opinion/no-model-for-muslim-democracy.html">into his government</a> and has suppressed religious minorities.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Most_Canadians_believe_Islam_is_irreconcilable_with_the_West">Most Canadians believe Islam is irreconcilable with the West</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">A majority of Canadians believes conflict between Western nations and the Muslim world is &quot;irreconcilable,&quot; according to a new national survey that revealed a strong strain of pessimism in the country leading up to Sunday's 10th anniversary commemorations of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. 
<p>The survey of 1,500 Canadians, conducted over three days last week for the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies, showed 56 per cent of respondents see Western and Muslim societies locked in an unending ideological struggle, while about 33 per cent — just one-third of the population — held out hope that the conflict will eventually be overcome. 
</p><p>Another 11 per cent of those polled didn't answer the question. 
</p><p>ACS executive director Jack Jedwab said the finding has &quot;serious ramifications&quot; for Canadian policies aimed at bridging divides between cultures, which are based on the premise that citizens believe significant progress in mending such religious and cultural conflicts is achievable. 
</p><p>The dark view expressed in the survey &quot;contradicts a fundamental idea in multicultural democracies like ours, that conflicts between societies can be resolved through dialogue and negotiation,&quot; said Jedwab. &quot;This is also a key element in multiculturalism, where Canada is often seen elsewhere in the world as a model in conflict resolution.&quot; 
</p><p>He adds: &quot;If a majority of Canadians feel it is irreconcilable, what does this imply for the various projects and programs in place that aim to bridge gaps?&quot; 
</p><p>The online survey, carried out Sept. 6 to 8 by the firm Leger Marketing, is considered accurate to within 2.9 percentage points 19 times out of 20. 
</p><p>The results also confirm the findings of other recent surveys highlighting Canadians' ongoing anxiety about the state of security in the post-9/11 world and their deep doubts about whether the long and bloody war in Afghanistan has done much to thwart the threat of terrorism. 
</p><p>In fact, 65 per cent of respondents in the ACS survey said they don't believe the world is safer from terrorists today than it was 10 years ago. And 70 per cent of those surveyed said they don't believe the war in Afghanistan has reduced the chances of terrorist attacks. 
</p><p>Jedwab said the &quot;pessimistic feeling&quot; about what the war has accomplished is likely linked to the &quot;widespread hopelessness&quot; about the prospects for ever resolving the deep-rooted, &quot;ideological&quot; conflict between Muslim and Western societies. 
</p><p>Many Canadians have come to believe &quot;nothing will work&quot; to end that conflict, said Jedwab, adding that this grim state of mind will require more scrutiny to fully understand and more carefully crafted public policies to rebuild a sense of optimism about the future of global relations. 
</p><p>The survey did offer one notable &quot;ray of hope,&quot; Jedwab suggested, pointing to a result showing that a slight majority of Canadians (52 per cent) believe it would be wrong for airport security officials to do &quot;extra checks&quot; of &quot;passengers who appear to be of Muslim background.&quot; 
</p>
While 39 per cent of respondents were open to that kind of profiling, Jedwab interpreted the majority's rejection of the practice as a sign that most Canadians realize such infringements &quot;would make the purportedly irreconcilable conflict even deeper if the enshrined principles of our rights charters are to be disregarded.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">September 2011</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Most Americans believe the U.S. should reduce or eliminate its more than $1 billion a year in financial aid to Egypt.
<p>The issue is a hot topic as Egypt struggles in the aftermath of the revolution that toppled Hosni Mubarak’s government.  More than dozen American democracy and human rights activists face charges in Egypt and are being forbidden from leaving the country.  Another complication: The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement, may be poised to gain power in Egypt.
</p><p>In our national scientific telephone poll, we put this question to Americans: “Do you believe that the U.S. should maintain, reduce, or halt providing Egypt with more than $1 billion a year in U.S. financial aid?”
</p><p>In response, 14% said maintain the aid the $1 billion+ a year in aid, 44% said reduce the aid, and 33% said halt the aid altogether.
</p><p>Along partisan lines, independents (43%) and Republicans (40%) most favored ending U.S. aid to Egypt.

<div class="quotes">The United States has given billions of dollars to Egypt in recent decades, but research published Tuesday by a major think tank [a poll by the Washington-based Pew Research Center] suggests <b>most Egyptians think American aid is having a &quot;negative effect.&quot;</b><br>. . .<br>
<p><b>Cairo receives $1.3 billion annually from the U.S.</b> government in military aid, according to the State Department. However, the Pew poll shows <b>six in 10 Egyptians think it has a negative effect</b> – a figure that may prompt calls in the U.S. for aid to be cut.
</p>
Only one in five Egyptians have a positive attitude toward the United States, and less than one third expressed confidence in President Obama. Among young Egyptians, Obama’s popularity decreased by half in the past year.<sup id="cite_ref-NBCMay82012_14-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-NBCMay82012-14">[14]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">May, 2012</div></div>

<div class="quotes"><b>There are more than 10,000 extremist websites on the Internet compared to fewer than 100 countering them</b>, an analyst on Tuesday told a conference which stressed the need to rebut militant propaganda.
<p>&quot;In many ways, the terrorists are very successful in cyberspace,&quot; said counter-terrorism analyst Rohan Gunaratna, who heads the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore.
</p><p>&quot;It is very important for us to build in the next 10 years the capacities and capabilities to counter the increasing presence and the operation of these groups in cyberspace.&quot;<br>. . .<br>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a keynote speech that  self-radicalisation through constant exposure to radical views online was a &quot;growing phenomenon&quot;.
</p><p><b>&quot;Jihadist sites and sermons by charismatic ideologue firebrands are just a mouse click away,&quot;</b> said Lee, who also stressed the need for closer international cooperation against terrorism.
</p><p>Some 500 security analysts, academics and religious leaders attended the forum.
</p><p>Islamic scholar Ali Mohamed, co-chairman of Singapore's Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG), said cyberspace &quot;is shaping up to be the new battleground for hearts and minds&quot;.
</p><p>The RRG counsels and reindoctrinates jailed militants and helps them reintegrate into society, including some arrested in late 2001 for allegedly plotting to bomb US and other targets in the city-state.
</p><p>&quot;Terrorists are increasingly exploiting the Internet as a tool for mass communication and radicalisation,&quot; said Ali.
</p>
&quot;RRG believes that this is one of our greatest challenges today -- to deal (with) and counter the pervasive spread of terrorist ideologies and extremist views online.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Miscellaneous.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">March, 2013</div></div>
