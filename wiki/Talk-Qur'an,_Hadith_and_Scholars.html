<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i>
<p>my husband and i had an argument the other night and during that argument alot of hurtful things were said to each other and the argument got out of control, and he said the three talaaqs unknowingly without thinking of the consequences. within  minutes he realised what he had done, he did not mean it at all, it was said in a rage of anger and purely in an angry state. and he repented against it straight away and did taubah. however we were both in the nafaak state so i just want to know if the talaaq is valid and what do we do now. thank you.
</p><p><i>Answer:</i>
</p><p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful 
</p><p>Assalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatoh 
</p><p>The three talaqs issued in a state of anger are valid. The nikah has been terminated. Your’ll cannot stay together as husband and wife. The state of napaaki will not change the ruling.

Ibn Ishaq p. 308 (concerning the battle of Badr):
</p>
<div class="quotes">Then the apostle went forward until when he came out of the pass of al-Safra' he halted on the sandhill between the pass and al-Naziya called Sayar at a tree there and divided the booty which God had granted to the Muslims equally. Then he marched until he reached Rauha' when the Muslims met him congratulating him and the Muslims on the victory God had given him. Salama b. Salama—so 'Asim b. 'Umar b. Qatada and Yazid b. Ruman told me—said, 'What are you congratulating us about? By God, we only met some bald old women like the sacrificial camels who are hobbled, and we slaughtered them!' The apostle smiled and said, 'But, nephew, those were the chiefs' (380). When the apostle was in al-Safra', al-Nadr was killed by 'Ali, as a learned Meccan told me. When he was in 'Irqu'l-Zabya 'Uqba was killed (381). He had been captured by 'Abdullah b. Salima, one of the B. al-'Ajlan.
<b>When the apostle ordered him to be killed 'Uqba said, 'But who will look after my children, O Muhammad?' 'Hell', he said, and 'Asim b. Thabit b. Abu'l-Aqlah al-Ansari killed him</b> according to what Aim 'Ubayda b. Muhammad b. 'Ammar b. Yasir told me<br> </div>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Ibn 'Umar:<b>During the lifetime of the Prophet we used to avoid chatting leisurely and freely with our wives lest some Divine inspiration might be revealed concerning us.

<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. <b>Abu Bakr said &quot;But I am your brother.&quot;</b> The Prophet said, &quot;You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/062-sbt.php#007.062.018#007.062.018">7:62:18</a></div></div>
<p>Muhammad was casting lustful glances at his own stepdaughter, Durrah bint Abi Salamah. The wife who mentioned this to Muhammad was not even the child’s own mother, so his interest in Durrah must have been generally noticed around the household. Durrah was a newborn (or, as some say, not even born) when Muhammad became her stepfather in 626, so she was a maximum of six years old when he died. Hence she was between two and six in the following <i>hadiths</i>.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Narrated Umm Habibah ... I said, “O Allah’s Apostle! By Allah, we have heard that you want to marry Durrah, the daughter of Abu Salamah.” He said, “You mean the daughter of [my wife] Umm Salamah?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “By Allah! Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she would not be lawful for me to marry, for she is my foster niece, for Thuwaybah has suckled me and Abu Salamah; so you should neither present your daughters, nor your sisters to me.”<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/062-sbt.php#007.062.043#007.062.043">7:62:43</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Zaynab bint Salamah [sister of Durrah]. Umm Habibah said to Allah’s Apostle “We have heard that you want to marry Durrah bint Abi Salama.” Allah’s Apostle said, “Can she be married along with Umm Salamah [her mother]? Even if I have not married Umm Salamah, she would not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster brother.” “And there is no blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts.
