<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_meaning_of_this_verse">Basic meaning of this verse</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">The Quran is the only Holy Book that contains the phrase &quot;...marry only one.&quot;<br> </div>
<p>A common apologetic explanation for 4:3 is to give the above <i> partial </i> quote of the verse and explain that a Muslim man <i> may </i> <a href="wiki/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">marry</a> up to <a href="wiki/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">four women</a>. However, if he cannot deal justly with each of the wives then he has, he is <i> forbidden </i> to marry that many; and can marry only one wife, to prevent treating women unfairly. Muslims explain that the use of the word &quot;Justice&quot; or &quot;Justly&quot; (depending on which translation is being used) refers to the man's ability to treat each of his wives <i> exactly the same </i> in every regard: not just materially (ie. food, clothing, shelter, time, money, etc..) but also that he must be able to love them all exactly the same. He must be able to <i> feel </i> the same amount of affection and love for each of his wives. 
</p><p>If he cannot do this, then, according to the Qur'an he cannot marry more than one wife. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_injunction_against_polygamy">The injunction against polygamy</span></h4>
<div class="quotes"> <b> And you have it not in your power to do justice between wives, even though you may wish (it)...&quot; </b> <br> </div>
<p>Some <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> will provide more evidence to back up their interpretation of 4:3 by giving the <i> partial quote </i> of <a href="wiki/Unjust_Treatment_of_Wives_(Qur'an_4-129).html" title="Unjust Treatment of Wives (Qur'an 4:129)"> 4:129</a> as above. Since <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> says that you can only marry (up to) four women if you can deal Justly with them, and in 4:129, Allah tells us that men are unable to deal Justly with more than one wife. This means that men are generally not allowed to engage in polygamy. However, Allah included the allowance for multiple wives under specific circumstances. These include war, gender imbalance in certain regions/countries and women's preference. 
</p><p>After a war where a lot of men are killed, there are usually much higher numbers of women alive than men. In this case,  men are permitted to take more than one wife, in order to reproduce at a faster rate than normal in order to repopulate the region. Women are more prevalent in some areas of the world, and men are also allowed to marry multiple wives when this is the situation, in order to ensure that every woman has a male partner and doesn't have to fend for herself. Some women also prefer to be a second, third or fourth wife; thus polygamy is also allowed in order to accommodate the desires of these women.
</p><p>But as a general rule, as stated, men are prohibited from engaging in polygamy unless absolutely necessary.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id=".27Qur.27an-only.27_explanation">'Qur'an-only' explanation</span></h4>
<p>The few who reject the ahadith altogether, except when it is necessary in order to explain an <a href="wiki/Five_Pillars_of_Islam.html" title="Five Pillars of Islam">Islamic Pillar</a>, give an explanation of 4:3 as being an injunction against polygamy under any circumstances. They back their claim up by quoting <a href="wiki/Unjust_Treatment_of_Wives_(Qur'an_4-129).html" title="Unjust Treatment of Wives (Qur'an 4:129)"> 4:129</a>
</p>
<div class="quotes"> <b> And you have it not in your power to do justice between wives, even though you may wish (it), but be not disinclined (from one) with total disinclination, so that you leave her as it were in suspense; and if you effect a reconciliation and guard (against evil), then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. </b> <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.129#004.129">4:129</a></div></div>
<p>The reasoning continues that a man can <i> never </i> treat his wives equally, thus 4:3 means: Don't treat orphans unfairly, by marrying their mothers in order to gain access to the wealth that the orphans will inherit when they come of age. Then 4:3 changes the topic, mid ayat and tells men that they can marry up to four free (believing) women, but if they cannot treat them fairly, then they can marry only one. Then 4:3 goes back to who they are allowed to marry, and says they may also marry captives (from their right hands), but that the injunction from the previous part of the verse still applies.
</p><p>Ie. don't mistreat orphans by marrying their mothers to get their wealth &gt;&gt; Men can marry believing women; 2 or 3 or 4 &gt;&gt; If you can't treat them all exactly the same (fairly) then they can only marry <i> one. </i> &gt;&gt; Men can also marry their captives but &quot;treat them fairly&quot; rule still applies.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Problems_with_the_apologetic_interpretation">Problems with the apologetic interpretation</span></h4>
<p>The main issue with the above interpretation of 4:3 <i> and </i> the claim regarding 4:129 , is that proponents of these interpretations must quote the verses out of context in order to &quot;explain the meaning.&quot; They quote a small portion of the verse(s) and and use it to suit the explanation. However the interpretation that they give ignores the majority of the verse(s); and renders the whole verse(s) nonsensical if read in context.
</p><p>Those who explain the two verses completely as an injunction against polygamy would have to dismiss all sahih ahadith as not being authentic, for no other reason than it contradicts their own interpretation of the verse. They would also have to admit that 4:3 is badly written and not clear in its intended meaning. By doing this, they would contradict the Muslim belief that the Qur'an is a <i> perfect literary masterpiece, that could not have been written by any human being. </i> In order for the Qur'an to remain the &quot;literary masterpiece&quot; claimed, and this explanation to be correct, the verse would be more properly written thus:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> <i> Quran 4:3 And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then do not marry their mothers. Instead, marry other women; believing women or captives from your right hand; two or three or four. But if you fear you cannot do justice between them, then marry only one. This is better for you than to deviate from the right course. </i> <br> </div>
<p>Most apologists, because of this,  will avoid answering any questions as to the meaning of the whole verse(s) in order to stick to their own interpretation.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Evidence_From_sahih_ahadith_as_to_the_meaning_of_4:3">Evidence From sahih ahadith as to the meaning of 4:3</span></h4>
<p>The true meaning of Qur'an 4:3 is explained to us by <a href="wiki/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> in Bukhari's <i> Sahih </i> ahadith collection:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:
<p>That he had asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the Statement of Allah: &quot;If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four.&quot; (4.3)
</p><p>She said, &quot;O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were ordered to marry any other woman.&quot; 'Aisha further said, &quot;After that verse the people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan 'girls), so Allah revealed the following verses:-- 'They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to marry...&quot; (4.127)
</p>
What is meant by Allah's Saying:-- 'And about what is Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:-- 'If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.' (4.3) 'Aisha said, &quot;Allah's saying in the other verse:--'Yet whom you desire to marry' (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy).&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/044-sbt.php#003.044.674#003.044.674">3:44:674</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Az-Zuhri:
<p>Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked 'Aisha about the meaning of the Quranic Verse:--
</p><p>&quot;And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.&quot; (4.2-3)
</p><p>Aisha said, &quot;It is about a female orphan under the guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth, and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later on the people asked Allah's Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:--
</p><p>&quot;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them...&quot; (4.127)
</p>
and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/051-sbt.php#004.051.025#004.051.025">4:51:25</a></div></div>

that he asked 'Aisha regarding the Verse: 'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans (4.3) She said, &quot;O my nephew! This Verse refers to the orphan girl who is under the guardianship of her guardian who likes her beauty and wealth and wishes to (marry her and) curtails her Mahr. Such guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice by giving them their full Mahr and they have been ordered to marry other than them. The people asked for the verdict of Allah's Apostle after that, so Allah revealed: 'They ask your instruction concerning the women . . . whom you desire to marry.' (4.127) So Allah revealed to them that if the orphan girl had beauty and wealth, they desired to marry her and for her family status. They can only marry them if they give them their full Mahr. And if they had no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them, when they had no interest, in them, they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest, unless they treated them justly and gave them their full Mahr[/size] Apostle said, 'If at all there is evil omen, it is in the horse, the woman and the house.&quot; a lady is to be warded off.

<div class="quotes">Narrated Aisha&quot;
(regarding) the Verse: 'And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans...' (4.3) It is about the orphan girl who is in the custody of a man who is her guardian, and he intends to marry her because of her wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly and honestly. Such a man should marry women of his liking other than her, two or three or four. 'Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: ...your foster-mothers (who suckled you).' (4.23) Marriage is prohibited between persons having a foster suckling relationship corresponding to a blood relationship which renders marriage unlawful. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/062-sbt.php#007.062.035#007.062.035">7:62:35</a></div></div>

'If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with orphan girls (to the end of the verse) that your right hands possess?&quot; (4.3) Aisha said, &quot;O my nephew! It was about the female orphan under the protection of her guardian who was interested in her beauty and wealth and wanted to marry her with a little or reduced Mahr.

(4.127) So Allah revealed to them in this Verse that-if a female orphan had wealth and beauty, they desired to marry her and were interested in her noble descent and the reduction of her Mahr; but if she was not desired by them because of her lack in fortune and beauty they left her and married some other woman.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Evidence_from_tafsir.27s_regarding_4:3">Evidence from tafsir's regarding 4:3</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">(And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other) women of your choice, two) Allah commands, when one of you is the caretaker of a female orphan  and he fears that he might not give her a dowry that is suitable for women of her status, he should marry other women , who are plenty as Allah has not restricted him. Al-Bukhari recorded that `A'ishah said, &quot;A man was taking care of a female orphan and he married her, although he did not desire to marry her. That girl's money was mixed with his, and he was keeping her portion from her. Afterwards, this Ayah was revealed about his case;
<p>﴿وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ﴾
</p><p>(If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly)<i> Al-Bukhari recorded that `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr said that he asked `A'ishah about the meaning of the statement of Allah,</i>
</p><p>﴿وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تُقْسِطُواْ فِى الْيَتَـمَى﴾
</p><p>(If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls.) She said, &quot;O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him to marry her without giving her an adequate dowry which might have been given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable dowry; otherwise they were ordered to marry woman besides them.<i> `A'ishah further said, &quot;After that verse, the people again asked the Messenger of Allah (about marriage with orphan girls), so Allah revealed the Ayah,</i>
</p><p>﴿وَيَسْتَفْتُونَكَ فِى النِّسَآءِ﴾
</p><p>(They ask your instruction concerning the women..) ﴿4:127﴾.<i> She said, &quot;Allah's statement in this Ayah,</i>
</p><p>﴿وَتَرْغَبُونَ أَن تَنكِحُوهُنَّ﴾
</p><p>(yet whom you desire to marry) ﴿4:127﴾ refers to the guardian who does not desire to marry an orphan girl under his supervision because she is neither wealthy nor beautiful. The guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are neither beautiful nor wealthy).
</p><p>﴿مَثْنَى وَثُلَـثَ وَرُبَاعَ﴾
</p><p>(two or three, or four), means, marry as many women as you like, other than the orphan girls, two, three or four. We should mention that Allah's statement in another Ayah,
</p><p>﴿جَاعِلِ الْمَلَـئِكَةِ رُسُلاً أُوْلِى أَجْنِحَةٍ مَّثْنَى وَثُلَـثَ وَرُبَـعَ﴾
</p><p>(Who made the angels messengers with wings, - two or three or four) ﴿35:1﴾, does not mean that other angels do not have more than four wings, as there are proofs that some angels do have more wings. Yet, men are prohibited from marrying more than four wives, as the Ayah decrees, since the Ayah specifies what men are allowed of wives, as Ibn `Abbas and the majority of scholars stated. If it were allowed for them to have more than four wives, the Ayah would have mentioned it. Imam Ahmad recorded that Salim said that his father said that Ghilan bin Salamah Ath-Thaqafi had ten wives when he became Muslim, and the Prophet said to him, &quot;Choose any four of them (and divorce the rest).<i> During the reign of `Umar, Ghilan divorced his remaining wives and divided his money between his children. When `Umar heard news of this, he said to Ghilan, &quot;I think that the devil has conveyed to your heart the news of your imminent death, from what the devil hears during his eavesdropping. It may as well be that you will not remain alive but for a little longer. By Allah! You will take back your wives and your money, or I will take possession of this all and will order that your grave be stoned as is the case with the grave of Abu Righal (from Thamud, who was saved from their fate because he was in the Sacred Area. But, when he left it, he was tormented like they were).</i> Ash-Shafi`i, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi collected this Hadith up to the Prophet's statement, &quot;Choose any four of them.<i> Only Ahmad collected the full version of this Hadith. Therefore, had it been allowed for men to marry more than four women at the same time, the Prophet would have allowed Ghilan to keep more than four of his wives since they all embraced Islam with him. When the Prophet commanded him to keep just four of them and divorce the rest, this indicated that men are not allowed to keep more than four wives at a time under any circumstances. If this is the case concerning those who already had more than four wives upon embracing Islam, then this ruling applies even more so to marrying more than four.</i>
</p><p>﴿فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ فَوَحِدَةً أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَـنُكُمْ﴾
</p><p>(But if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or what your right hands possess.) The Ayah commands, if you fear that you will not be able to do justice between your wives by marrying more than one, then marry only one wife, or satisfy yourself with only female captives, for it is not obligatory to treat them equally, rather it is recommended. So if one does so, that is good, and if not, there is no harm on him. In another Ayah, Allah said,
</p><p>﴿وَلَن تَسْتَطِيعُواْ أَن تَعْدِلُواْ بَيْنَ النِّسَآءِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتُمْ﴾
</p><p><br>
(You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire) ﴿4:129﴾. Allah said,
</p><p>﴿ذلِكَ أَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ﴾
</p><p>(That is nearer to prevent you from Ta`ulu), meaning, from doing injustice. Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduwyah and Abu Hatim Ibn Hibban, in his Sahih, recorded that `A'ishah said that, the Prophet said that the Ayah,
</p><p>﴿ذلِكَ أَدْنَى أَلاَّ تَعُولُواْ﴾
</p><p>(That is nearer to prevent you from Ta`ulu), means, from doing injustice. However, Ibn Abi Hatim said that his father said that this Hadith to the Prophet is a mistake, for it should be attributed to `A'ishah not the Prophet . Ibn Abi Hatim reported from Ibn `Abbas, `A'ishah, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Abu Malik, Abu Razin, An-Nakha`i, Ash-Sha`bi, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Muqatil bin Hayyan that Ta`ulu means to deviate ﴿from justice﴾.
</p><p>Ali bin Abi Talhah reported Ibn `Abbas saying, Nihlah, in Allah's statement,
</p><p>﴿وَءَاتُواْ النِّسَآءَ صَدُقَـتِهِنَّ نِحْلَةً﴾
</p><p>(And give to the women (whom you marry) their Saduqat Nihlah) refers to the dowry. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated from Az-Zuhri that `Urwah said that `A'ishah said that `Nihlah' means `obligatory'. Muqatil, Qatadah and Ibn Jurayj said, `Nihlah' means `obligatory' Ibn Jurayj added: `specified.' Ibn Zayd said, &quot;In Arabic, Nihlah, refers to what is necessary. So Allah is commanding: Do not marry unless you give your wife something that is her right. No person after the Prophet is allowed to marry a woman except with the required dowry, nor by giving false promises about the dowry ﴿intended﴾.<i> Therefore, the man is required to pay a dowry to his wife with a good heart, just as he gives a gift with a good heart. If the wife gives him part or all of that dowry with a good heart, her husband is allowed to take it, as it is lawful for him in this case. This is why Allah said afterwards,</i>
</p><p>﴿فَإِن طِبْنَ لَكُمْ عَن شَىْءٍ مِّنْهُ نَفْساً فَكُلُوهُ هَنِيئاً مَّرِيئاً﴾

(And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans) and if you fear that you will not preserve orphans' wealth, you should also fear not dealing fairly with women in relation to providing sustenance and apportionment. This was because they used to marry as many women as they liked, as many as nine or ten. Qays Ibn al-Harth for example had eight wives. Allah forbade them from doing so and prohibited them from marrying more than four wives, saying: (marry of the women, who seem good to you) marry that which Allah has made lawful for you, (two or three or four) marry one, two, three or four but do not marry more than four wives; (and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice) to four wives in relation to apportionment and providing sustenance (then one (only)) then marry only one free woman (or that your right hands possess) of captives, and in that case you do not owe them any apportionment, and they need not observe any waiting period.

The custodian refuses to give this orphan in marriage out of greed for her money, harms her and treats her badly. And so Allah, exalted is He, says (And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans marry of the women, who seem good to you…) as long as they are lawful to you and leave this one”. This was narrated by Muslim&gt; Abu Kurayb&gt; Abu Usamah&gt; Hisham.

And sometimes they were fair to them and sometimes they were not. So when they asked about the orphans and the verse (Give unto orphans their wealth), regarding the orphans, was revealed, Allah, exalted is He, also revealed (And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans). He says here: ‘Just as you fear that you will not deal fairly by the orphan, so should you fear that you do not deal fairly by women. Therefore, marry only as many as you can fulfill their rights, for women are like orphans as far as weakness and incapacity are concerned’.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Although the ahadith above do not discuss the verse in its entirety, the <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsirs</a> do. It is important to note that Aisha and the tafsir writers have defined &quot;justice&quot; for us. Kathir even makes it plain that 4:3 is not referring to perfect justice, so th alleged injunction against polygamy is invalid.  As &quot;justice&quot; is used twice in the verse in connection with two different types of women (orphans and free women) it is apparent that Justice means the same thing both times it is used. It would be incorrect to assume that &quot;justice&quot; means <a href="wiki/Mahr.html" title="Mahr">mahr</a> in relation to orphans and something else for free women given the context of the verse. One more verse that needs to be considered in order to understand 4.3 is as follows:
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And whoever among you '<b>has not within his power ampleness of means to marry free believing women, then (he may marry) of those whom your right hands possess'</b> from among your believing maidens; and Allah knows best your faith: you are (sprung) the one from the other; so marry them with the permission of their masters, '<b>and give them their dowries justly'</b>, they being chaste, not fornicating, nor receiving paramours; and when they are taken in marriage, then if they are guilty of indecency, they shall suffer half the punishment which is (inflicted) upon free women. This is for him among you who fears falling into evil; and that you abstain is better for you, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.025#004.025">4:25</a> </div></div>
<p>In light of all the information provided above, if we wish to give Qur'an 4.3 its full expansive meaning it would read something like this:
</p>
<div class="quotes"> <b> &quot;If you are going to pay Orphans Less of a Mahr, or are just marrying them to get their property/wealth (or preventing them from marrying), then marry other women, 2 or 3 or 4, but if you cannot afford them (mahr, or support) then marry only one or a captive that your right hand possesses (as the Mahr is half that of a free woman or even nothing). This is better for you, than being financially unjust with your women.&quot; </b> <br> </div>
<p>Quran 4:3 has nothing to do with treating your wives equally, its about the orphan's and their Mahr. Injustice in this verse is talking about financial equality regarding bride price (for orphans) and financial viability of having that many wives, not equality between them.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_Views">Alternative Views</span></h2>
<p>Dividing the ayah into several pieces will make it easier to get a grip on an alternative view, which is not related to the mahr story in any way.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="And_if_you_fear_that_you_cannot_act_equitably_towards_orphans_...">And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans ...</span></h4>
<p>An orphan (yateem) is a child whose father is unknown. This can be the result of any of the situations listed below: 
</p>
<ol><li>Father is dead</li>
<li>Father can not be found in any way </li>
<li>Mother has been raped or had sex with another man during pregnancy</li>
<li>Child is the result of adultery (zina)</li>
<li>Child is of a maid bought or enslaved at war</li>
<li>Child is the result of adultery (zina) of a maid with a man other than her owner</li>
<li>Child is the result of permitted adultery of a maid with a man other than her owner</li></ol>
<p>Free orphans can be protected by other males whether they are related or not to the child. If a woman marries another man after her husband dies or somehow becomes untraceable, her orphans (underage children) will also be under the protection of the new father. Orphans of slaves are also slaves. But if a maid gives birth to a child of her owner, then the child is free.
</p><p>According to Abu Dawud, a child can not be called an orphan after reaching the age of puberty.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dealing_Justly_with_Wives_and_Orphans_(Qur'an_4-3).html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Puberty can only be understood when the child experiences his first nocturnal ejaculation (wet dream) during his sleep if it's a boy or has her first period if it's a girl. 
</p><p>So, the orphans that are subject to marriage are <i>underage girls</i>. Of course Islam does not have strict rules limiting the age of marriage, and as seen with Muhammad's marriage to Aisha, marriage to very young girls were also a common practice among early Muslims. 
</p>
<a href="wiki/Purpose_of_the_Mahr.html" title="Purpose of the Mahr">Mahr</a> is by definition <div class="quotes"> the amount of money to be paid by the groom to the bride, at the time of marriage <br> </div> In fact it can be any goods of certain value that both the groom and the bride or bride's protector (her father, brothers, owner etc.) agree on. In this scenario, where a man wants to marry the child under his protection, both sides of the agreement are either the protector, or the protector and an underage child which is still at the early stages of mental development with no prior experience of marriage or mahr agreement. Therefore not paying mahr &quot;justly&quot; is definitely not an issue here.
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="then_marry_such_women_as_seem_good_to_you.2C_two_and_three_and_four_...">then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four ...</span></h4>
<p>&quot;Women&quot; in numbers beginning from two, going up to four. In fact, four is not a limit here, considering the language of the Qur'an, it's just a way of saying &quot;as many as you need&quot;. Number 4 would have strictly been put in that way, if it was a limitation. Therefore, here it means &quot;have as many women as you need to feed your desires&quot;. This definitely shows that the ayah is in no way related to paying mahr justly, for the mahr of many women will definitely cost more than that of an underage child with low judgmental and valuation skills. It is irrational for one that does not want to pay the child's mahr accordingly, to pay more mahr as an alternative. Approaching from the other side, knowing the uncontrollable <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Sexuality.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Sexuality">sexual desires of early Muslims</a>, marrying 2, 3, 4 or more women (of any age) is always preferable than marrying to one, so an ayah ordering the obvious is unnecessary.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="but_if_you_fear_that_you_will_not_do_justice_.28between_them.29.2C_then_.28marry.29_only_one_...">but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one ...</span></h4>
Only in this part, the mahr is one of the possible reasons for the injustice. Marriage requires paying mahr, and paying different amount of mahr to several women may cause problems between the wives. Also it is possible that problems similar to those between Muhammad and his wives may occur. Therefore, here it means <div class="quotes"> if you fear that you will not be able to act justly between your wives (economically and socially), then content yourself with only one<br> </div> 
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="or_what_your_right_hands_possess_...">or what your right hands possess ...</span></h4>
<p>Many times in the Qur'an, maids and slaves are referred to as &quot;what your right hand possess&quot;.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h4>
<div class="quotes"> If you fear you cannot act equitably towards orphans, than marry as many as women you need. If you can not (economically, psychologically, socially etc.) handle many women, then content yourself with only one. If you can not marry even one, than keep going on with the maid(s) you already have<br> </div>
<p>It is clear that the ayah is not in any way about paying an underage child the mahr justly, but about fulfilling one's sexual needs. But why would fulfilling sexual needs scare a man as long as he marries the orphan child legally? Who are those orphans?
</p>
<ul><li> They are not the orphan step daughters of the man, for <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.023#004.023">4:23</a> strictly forbids having intercourse both with women and their daughters.</li>
<li> They are not free orphan children in any way, for it's not illegal to marry a child regardless of her age as it's seen on Muhammad and Aisha's, Omar and Ali's daughter Ummu Gulsum's marriages etc.</li></ul>
<p>After eliminating the other possibilities by the help of facts above, the only possibility left is: those are the man's maids' orphan children. Let's see how it is.
</p><p>In <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php#024.033#024.033">24:33</a> it is seen that the maids were also forced into prostitution by their owners. Maids or slaves were considered property, owners had the right to use them in any way they wanted. Maids were used for prostitution, as treats to the owners' friends, for paying owners' debts etc. 
</p><p>As stated above, the child would be considered &quot;free&quot; if the father was the maid's owner. But if not, then the child would also be a slave or maid and used by the master.
</p><p>At that time, there was no way of knowing who the father of the child was, if a woman - even if she was already pregnant from a certain man - had sexual intercourse with other men.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dealing_Justly_with_Wives_and_Orphans_(Qur'an_4-3).html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> 
</p><p>If a maid is offered to other men and used by her owner at the same time, or was already pregnant when she got bought/earned at war and used by her owner during her pregnancy, then that would make the child an orphan and require the master to decide the child's fate, whether to make the child free or making it a slave. If he makes the child a slave, then he would have all the rights to use it as a sex toy as well.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion_2">Conclusion</span></h4>
<p>The orphans mentioned in that ayah are those maids' children whose fathers are unknown, for the maids were used by both their owners and other men. And the real meaning of the ayah is:
</p>
<div class="quotes">If you fear from acting unjustly in the eye of Allah by using your own child as a sex toy (without knowing it), marry other women as many as you need (because they are definitely not your close relatives), but if you can not marry other women due to economical or other reasons, then content yourself with the maids you already have<br> </div>
