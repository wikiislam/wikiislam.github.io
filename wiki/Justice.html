<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scales_of_Justice">Scales of Justice</span></h2>
<p>Scales can be considered a universal sign for justice. Even the ancient religions had such a concept. Maat, the Egyptian goddess of truth, right, and orderly conduct holds the scales which weigh the human heart in the judgment of the dead. Iustitia, the Roman's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice" class="extiw" title="w:Lady Justice">Lady Justice</a>, is another goddess of justice who carries measuring balances. And the book of Daniel refers to scales being used to judge a man just as with other ancient religions.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Justice.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Law_of_Honest_Scales">The Law of Honest Scales</span></h3>
<p>The Tanakh codified the law that scales and measuring balances be honest. Such a rule and similar statements can be found in the <a href="wiki/Torah.html" title="Torah" class="mw-redirect">Torah</a><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Justice.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> and the book of Proverbs<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Justice.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Justice.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>. The Qur'an does the same:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Give just measure, and cause no loss (to others by fraud). And weigh with scales true and upright.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/026-qmt.php#026.00181-182#026.00181-182">26:181-182</a></div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Dishonest_Scales_of_Allah">The Dishonest Scales of Allah</span></h2>
<p>The evil deeds of a rich man, when placed upon <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah's</a> scales of judgment, will weigh more than had he been a poor man.  We know this because the atonement (the good deed required to make up for the evil deed) is different depending on one's income level.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Abu Huraira: 
While we were sitting with the Prophet a man came and said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! I have been ruined.&quot; Allah's Apostle asked what was the matter with him. He replied &quot;I had sexual intercourse with my wife while I was fasting.&quot; Allah's Apostle asked him, &quot;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&quot; He replied in the negative. Allah's Apostle asked him, &quot;Can you fast for two successive months?&quot; He replied in the negative. The Prophet asked him, &quot;Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?&quot; He replied in the negative. The Prophet kept silent and while we were in that state, a big basket full of dates was brought to the Prophet . He asked, &quot;Where is the questioner?&quot; He replied, &quot;I (am here).&quot; The Prophet said (to him), &quot;Take this (basket of dates) and give it in charity.&quot; The man said, &quot;Should I give it to a person poorer than I? By Allah; there is no family between its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains who are poorer than I.&quot; The Prophet smiled till his pre-molar teeth became visible and then said, 'Feed your family with it.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/031-sbt.php#003.031.157#003.031.157">3:31:157</a></div></div>
<p>On the surface it would appear that a rich man's penalty should be more than a poor man's because a poor man cannot afford to pay as much as one who is wealthy, and the hardship suffered by exacting equal payment will be unequal--the poor man will suffer more than the rich man would.
</p><p>However, one must ask this important question: <b>Why is the man poor or rich in the first place?</b>
</p><p>Wealth can be accumulated by luck or dishonest means, that is true. However, wealth is often-times acquired through perseverance, hard work, and intelligence.  In the same token, poverty can occur due to bad luck or being the victim of unjust acts, but it can also occur because of laziness and poor decision-making.
</p><p>The scales of Allah violate not only the concept of justice in modern, developed nations but they also violate the concept of justice in the Torah by showing partiality to the poor.
</p><p>True justice demands punishment based on the transgression...not the income level of the transgressor.

<div class="quotes">Narrated Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As: 
<p>The value of the blood-money at the time of the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was eight hundred dinars or eight thousand dirhams, and <b>the blood-money for the people of the Book was half of that for Muslims</b>.

He said: This applied till Umar (Allah be pleased with him) became caliph and he made a speech in which he said: Take note! Camels have become dear. So Umar fixed the value for those who possessed gold at one thousand dinars, for those who possessed silver at twelve thousand (dirhams), for those who possessed cattle at two hundred cows, for those who possessed sheep at two thousand sheep, and for those who possessed suits of clothing at two hundred suits. He left the blood-money for dhimmis (protected people) as it was, not raising it in proportion to the increase he made in the blood-wit.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Abu Dawud</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/039-sat.php#039.4527#039.4527">39:4527</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">The maximum amount of Death Compensation (Diyya) generally admissible in Saudi Arabia,  in respect of road/traffic/fire accident, murder, etc. is as under:

In the case of death of a female, death compensation allowed is equal to half the amount as admissible to males professing the same religion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Islamic_Scholar_on_Justice_and_Human_Rights">Islamic Scholar on Justice and Human Rights</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">The Muslim should not be deceived by the so called western and European “human rights” organizations, because although they outwardly appear to support the oppressed and to take a stance against torture and undermining of human dignity in prisons and detention centres – which in general terms are good ideas – they also play other roles, and support other principles which are aimed at destroying the family, and opening the door to slander against Islam and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and all his fellow-Prophets. They are opposed to the rule of sharee’ah which enjoins hadd punishments such as stoning for the adulterer, execution for the apostate and cutting off the hand for the thief, becoming part of legislation and being implemented, which is in fact very rare. These organizations are also opposed to the shar’i rulings that have to do with women, such as the necessity of her wali’s consent for marriage, the command to observe hijab, and the prohibition on her mixing, in addition to other principles where they claim that they want to liberate man from religious obligations and to make man free in the way he conducts his affairs, not restricted by good morals or sublime shar’i rulings.<br><br>
<p>To sum up what these organizations promote: it is that man should be able to do whatever he wants, no matter how perverse. They support lesbians, homosexuals and bisexuals, and religious deviance. They regard it as a human right to disbelieve in whatever religions one wants and to express one’s opinion – even about the Prophets – without any fear or shame, and they also support the liberation of woman from the control of her father, husband or religion.<br><br>
</p><p>Secondly:<br>
</p><p>There follow some of the articles of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration on Human Rights</a>, which was approved by the United Nations on 10/12/1948 CE, which we are quoting from their website: <i>[Quotes from Articles 2, 18, &amp; 19]</i><br>
</p><p>These so called rights and freedoms which they call for all people to enjoy regardless of religion make the monotheist and the polytheist equally entitled to these rights and freedoms, so the slave of Allaah and the slave of the Shaytaan are placed on the same level, and every worshipper of rocks, idols or people is given the complete right and freedom to enjoy his kufr and heresy. This is contrary to the laws of Allaah in this world and the Hereafter. <i>[Quotes <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/068-qmt.php#068.0035-36#068.0035-36">68:35-36</a>, <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/038-qmt.php#038.028#038.028">38:28</a>, &amp; <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/032-qmt.php#032.018#032.018">32:18</a>]</i><br>
</p><p>It is a call to abolish the ruling on apostasy, and to openly flaunt the principles of kufr and heresy. It is a call to open the door to everyone who wants to criticize Islam or the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and to have the freedom to criticize and express oneself with no restrictions. 
These are corrupt principles. Even if they suit their lives, values and religion, they do not suit us and they are contrary to our pure sharee’ah, which brought rulings that are suited to individuals and societies, and establish noble morals, and protect minds, honour, physical well being and wealth, and show people the religion which Allaah loves and is pleased with.<br>
</p><p><i>[Quotes from Article 3]</i>  It is from this Article that the calls of these organizations come to protect criminals against execution, and started to give bad publicity to the nations which carry out the hadd punishments of Allaah by stoning married adulterers and executing bandits and those who spread mischief in the land. Now these organizations proudly claim that they have convinced many nations to abolish the death penalty for killers, rapists and criminals. This is contrary to sound human nature, reason and sharee’ah, and it is a message that gives peace of mind to those criminals that their lives will never be lost because of their deeds, which is a way of spreading mischief on earth.<br>
They claim that the individual has the right to life and liberty, even if it is a bestial life, and even if that freedom leads to corruption, sicknesses and loss of security for the family and society.<br>
</p><p><i>[Quotes from Article 16]</i>  This article annuls the role of the woman’s guardian (wali) which is to protect the woman’s rights in marriage, and to help his daughter or sister to make a good choice, and to ask about the religious commitment and character of the suitor. It is by His wisdom that Allaah has prescribed this. If marriage was left up to the woman without her guardian’s consent, you would see most girls marrying those who enchant them of the wolves of men, who are eager to rob them of their chastity then throw them aside.<br> 
They also give the wife the same rights of divorce as the husband has. This is something that causes women to turn against their husbands and leads to the break up of their families. The one who knows the nature of men and women will not be able to agree to such nonsense. Western families are not so intact that we can say: Look at how they were destroyed. The call for homosexual rights and the rights of women to form any relationship she wants and women’s rights in marriage and divorce – what families can be built on such shaky foundations?<br> 
</p>
It is worth noting that these organizations are used for political purposes to put pressure on the Muslim states that care about virtue, modesty and morals, or that apply all or some of the rulings of sharee’ah. Some Muslim nations have abolished the death penalty, and they have introduced strict laws about marriage at an early age for both genders, but they pay attention to woman’s rights to khula’ and maintenance, etc, which causes widespread mischief and evil in many areas of life.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/97827">Western human rights organizations and the ruling on referring to them for judgement</a><br>Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 97827</div></div>
