<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mary_married_90-year-old_Joseph_when_she_was_only_12.2C_so_Joseph_was_a_pedophile_too">Mary married 90-year-old Joseph when she was only 12, so Joseph was a pedophile too</span></h3>
<p>Everyone who makes this claim, cite the same New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia page.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> What they do not mention is that this page begins by warning readers, &quot;the apocryphal literature is full of details, the non-admittance of these works into the Canon of the Sacred Books casts a <i>strong suspicion upon their contents</i>&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-Catholic_Encyclopedia_1_2-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Catholic_Encyclopedia_1-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>According to Wikipedia, apocrypha is defined as &quot;spurious&quot;, &quot;of questionable authenticity&quot;, and &quot;Christian texts that are not canonical.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Thus they can be considered as the Christian equivalent of da`if (weak) or maudu <a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html" title="List of Fabricated Hadith">(fabricated) hadith</a>. 
</p><p>Something that is non-canonical is not binding on a follower and can be ignored. There is no authoritative Christian text which state Mary's age. Claims about her age are, at best, educated guesses, but guesses none-the-less. <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Aisha.html#Aisha.27s_Age_at_Consummation_and_Marriage" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Aisha">Bukhari and Muslim</a>, on the other hand, are canonical <a href="wiki/Islam_and_Scripture.html" title="Islam and Scripture">Islamic writings</a> of the utmost religious <a href="wiki/Sahih.html" title="Sahih">authenticity</a>, accepted by approximately <a href="wiki/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">90 percent</a> of the world's Muslims.
</p><p>Even if we do accept this tu-quoque <a href="wiki/Logical_Fallacies.html" title="Logical Fallacies">logical fallacy</a> as a valid argument, there remains several problems. The first being the fact that the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia page does not say Mary married Joseph when she was aged only 12. 
</p><p>What it actually says, after warning readers once again that the stories are &quot;unreliable&quot;, is that Mary was 12 to 14 at the time of the choosing of candidates, and the Annunciation (the announcement by the angel <a href="wiki/Gabriel.html" title="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> to the <i>virgin</i> called Mary, that she would conceive and become the mother of Jesus)<sup id="cite_ref-Annun-age_4-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Annun-age-4">[4]</a></sup> took place two years later.<sup id="cite_ref-Catholic_Encyclopedia_2_5-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Catholic_Encyclopedia_2-5">[5]</a></sup> This would make Mary 14 to 16 at the time of her marriage, not 12, or 9, as was the case between <a href="wiki/Muhammad_and_the_Clinical_Definition_of_Pedophilia.html" title="Muhammad and the Clinical Definition of Pedophilia">Muhammad and Aisha</a>. She would have been a teenager of child-bearing age, not a pre-pubescent pre-teen child.
</p><p>Another problem is that the theological significance of Joseph and Muhammad to the Christian and <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> faiths are incomparable (i.e. the logical fallacy of <a href="wiki/False_Equivalence.html" title="False Equivalence">false equivalence</a>). Unlike the Muslim view of Muhammad, Christians do not consider Joseph to be an <a href="wiki/Uswa_Hasana.html" title="Uswa Hasana">uswa hasana</a> (excellent model of conduct). Joseph's moral character holds no importance within Christian theology. He could have been insane and it would not matter to a Christian.
</p><p>Then there is the fact that, according to both the Christian scriptures and the Islamic ones, Mary was a virgin when she conceived and gave birth to Jesus; therefore, her relationship with Joseph could not have been a sexual one until after Jesus' birth, making her possibly 17 years of age at the time the marriage was eventually consummated, if ever. 
</p><p>Indeed, the same New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia page continues the narrative of Joseph's life by stating both Mary and Joseph entered the marriage with the understanding that it was never to be consummated.<sup id="cite_ref-Catholic_Encyclopedia_4_6-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Catholic_Encyclopedia_4-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Mary's Perpetual virginity, the belief that Mary remained a virgin her entire life, is an essential article of faith for the majority of the world's Christians (including the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christians). It is even held by some Muslims.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Finally, the most decisive argument against the claim that Joseph was a pedophile is the fact that the same non-canonical writings which are used to gather information on Joseph and Mary's age, also confirm Mary's status as &quot;ever virgin&quot; (in The History of Joseph the Carpenter, Jesus says on Joseph's death &quot;my mother, virgin undefiled&quot;).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Catholic_and_Eastern_Churches_believe_Joseph_is_a_Saint.2C_that.27s_the_same_as_an_Uswa_Hasana">Catholic and Eastern Churches believe Joseph is a Saint, that's the same as an Uswa Hasana</span></h3>
<p>A saint and an uswa hasana are nothing alike. The entire Islamic faith, almost all of its laws, rituals, and moral principles, are defined by the uswa hasana's actions. A saint has no similar function in Christianity. Their actions do not determine Christian laws, rituals, or moral principles in any way. Joan of Arc and countless others are Catholic saints too, but that means very little to how one practices Christianity.
</p><p>Muhammad is the central figure of Islam, Joseph is not the central figure of Christianity. Islam wouldn't exist if Muslims decided Muhammad was immoral. On the other hand, for Christians of any stripe, Joseph is a &quot;non entity&quot; as far as its theology is concerned. The closest analogy to Muhammad and an uswa hasana in Christianity is the figure of Jesus, and very few non-Christians would argue that their view of Christians and Christianity would not improve if his followers behaved more like him.
</p><p>In addition, it is the same Catholic and Eastern Churches which consider Joseph a saint, who also hold to the belief of Mary's perpetual virginity. Since Mary's ever-lasting virginity is an integral part or &quot;pillar&quot; of their faith, and most modern theologians think the Pope could reverse a sainthood without undermining the Church's doctrines,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> it's not hard to imagine what would have become of Joseph's saint status if he did have intercourse with Mary. 
</p><p>Furthermore, as has already been stated in the previous section, Joseph cannot be labeled as a pedophile by anyones standards because there is no authoritative, or even apocryphal, Christian text that state an adult Joseph had sex with a child Mary. Therefore, even if the status of saint was equivalent to that of an uswa hasana, it would not matter to a Christian or help Muslims in excusing the actions of Muhammad.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Miscellaneous_points_to_consider">Miscellaneous points to consider</span></h3>
<p>Adding to the above text:
</p>
<ul><li>A pedophile by its very definition means someone who is sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. Teenagers of child-bearing age are not pre-pubescent.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Even if Joseph was a pedophile, a Christian could not be accused of hypocrisy for criticizing Muhammad's pedophilia. For them to be hypocrites, it is Jesus' actions, not Joseph's, which would have to mirror Muhammad's. This is because all critics, including Christians, criticize the founder of Islam, not the founder's father.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Related_Arguments">Related Arguments</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="If_Muhammad_was_a_pedophile.2C_then_so_is_the_Christian_god_for_impregnating_Mary">If Muhammad was a pedophile, then so is the Christian god for impregnating Mary</span></h3>
<p>Ignoring the fact that a pedophile by its very definition means someone who is sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> so a teenager of child-bearing age is not pre-pubescent, it has already been shown in a <a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#Mary_married_90-year-old_Joseph_when_she_was_only_12.2C_so_Joseph_was_a_pedophile_too">previous section</a> that there is no authoritative Christian text which state Mary's age. Claims about her age are, at best, educated guesses, but guesses none-the-less. 
</p><p>Additionally, the apocryphal literature (the Christian equivalent of <a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html" title="List of Fabricated Hadith">weak or fabricated hadith</a>) used to gather information on Mary's possible age actually reveal she may have been 16 at the time of her marriage, not 12. 
</p><p>Even if we were to assume she was 12 at the time, there still remain several problems with this claim.
</p><p>According to the Bible, Mary became with child by &quot;the power of the Highest&quot;,<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> a phrase that does not, or does not necessarily, correspond to Mary being &quot;impregnated.&quot;
</p><p>Even if we do accept that the Christian god &quot;impregnated&quot; Mary, both Christians and Muslims believe God is omnipotent. Therefore sexual intercourse, something which would have to take place if we were to accept this claim, is not necessary in order to achieve this. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination" class="extiw" title="w:Artificial insemination">artificial insemination</a> needs no sexual intercourse. If humans can create a method to impregnate people without the need for sexual intercourse, why can't an omnipotent deity do the same? Of course, from an omnipotent entity, this would not need to be a physical procedure, nor would there be a need for the hymen to be torn.
</p><p>Muslims also believe in the virgin birth. So, if Muslims insist the Christian god must have had sex with Mary in order to have a son, it is tantamount to an admission that, according to Islam, <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> must have also had sex with Mary in order for her to conceive Jesus.
</p><p>In short; the Christian text do not mention anything of a sexual nature, i.e. there was no penis or any other indicator suggesting a sexual experience. Clearly, if there was no physical contact involved, then there was no sexual contact. Without this much needed sexual contact, there is no pedophilia. 
</p><p>Conversely, the Qur'an explicitly tells us Allah (or Gabriel if we refer to the tafsir text) <a href="wiki/Allah_and_Marys_Vagina.html" title="Allah and Marys Vagina">blew into Mary's vagina</a> in order for her to conceive Jesus.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Jewish_Talmud_says_sex_with_a_little_girl_is_permitted_if_she_is_three_years_of_age">The Jewish Talmud says sex with a little girl is permitted if she is three years of age</span></h3>
<p>The claim that the Talmud says &quot;Sexual intercourse with a little girl is permitted if she is three years of age,&quot; is an <a href="wiki/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> lie. Yevamot 11b, the citation provided with this claim, has no relevant passage. 
</p><p>Whilst the language used is very crude, the discussion relates to the dowry for virgins and non-virgins. It has nothing to do with what acts are allowed, encouraged, forbidden, or discouraged. It is ironic that this passage has been manipulated from its original context of a financial discussion into one of a religious discussion. While there are numerous Talmudic passages of a religious nature, this one discusses dowries and not forbidden and permitted relations.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Americans_and_Europeans_both_considered_child_marriages_to_be_acceptable">Americans and Europeans both considered child marriages to be acceptable</span></h3>
<p>Yes, that is correct. But note the past tense. They <i>considered</i>, not <i>consider</i>. Marriage to young girls was previously seen as normal, and yet most Americans and Europeans today, both religious and secular, find child marriages to be repulsive. Could this be because they have no uswa hasana (an excellent model of conduct) who married and had sex with a child?
</p><p>This would explain why there is not a single mainstream Christian who argues in favor of child-marriages on the basis that &quot;Saint Joseph (<a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#Mary_married_90-year-old_Joseph_when_she_was_only_12.2C_so_Joseph_was_a_pedophile_too">allegedly</a>) did it 2000 years ago&quot;, &quot;King Richard II did it 600 years ago&quot; or that banning it would be &quot;un-Christian&quot;. N.B. Note that King Richard II's marriage to a child was never even consummated. Although he visited his young bride nearly every day, they lived in different houses and did not sleep under the same roof, let alone in the same bed. King Richard was murdered when Queen Isabella was only eleven years old, and she was at that time still a virgin. Medieval Europeans, especially royalty, frequently arranged marriages in which one or both parties were prepubescent. But it was extremely unusual for such a marriage to be consummated before puberty.
</p><p>On the other hand, the majority of mainstream Muslim scholars argue in favor of child-marriages on the basis that &quot;Prophet Muhammad did it 1400 years ago&quot;,<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Houston_13-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-University_of_Houston-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sheikh_Hamoud_14-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Sheikh_Hamoud-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mufti_Fazlul_15-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Mufti_Fazlul-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Imam_Sani_16-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Imam_Sani-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sheikh_Mohamed_Ben_17-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Sheikh_Mohamed_Ben-17">[17]</a></sup> &quot;the Prophet's <a href="wiki/Muhammad's_Companions_and_Pedophilia.html" title="Muhammad's Companions and Pedophilia">Companions did it</a>&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> or that banning it would be &quot;un-Islamic&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weekly_Blitz_20-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-Weekly_Blitz-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MESSAGE_21-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-MESSAGE-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IRIN_22-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-IRIN-22">[22]</a></sup> In some cases, Muhammad and Aisha's relationship has even been used to effectively &quot;turn back the clock&quot; by legalizing child marriages in places today where they were previously illegal.<sup id="cite_ref-World_News_Australia_23-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Joseph_the_Pedophile.html#cite_note-World_News_Australia-23">[23]</a></sup>

When forty years of age, Joseph married a woman called Melcha or Escha by some, Salome by others; they lived forty-nine years together and had six children, two daughters and four sons, the youngest of whom was James (the Less, &quot;the Lord's brother&quot;). A year after his wife's death, as the priests announced through Judea that they wished to find in the tribe of Juda a respectable man to espouse Mary, then twelve to fourteen years of age. Joseph, who was at the time ninety years old, went up to Jerusalem among the candidates; a miracle manifested the choice God had made of Joseph, and two years later the Annunciation took place. These dreams, as St. Jerome styles them, from which many a Christian artist has drawn his inspiration (see, for instance, Raphael's &quot;Espousals of the Virgin&quot;), are void of authority; they nevertheless acquired in the course of ages some popularity; in them some ecclesiastical writers sought the answer to the well-known difficulty arising from the mention in the Gospel of &quot;the Lord's brothers&quot;; from them also popular credulity has, contrary to all probability, as well as to the tradition witnessed by old works of art, retained the belief that St. Joseph was an old man at the time of marriage with the Mother of God.</i>&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08504a.htm&date=2011-10-24?url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08504a.htm&date=2011-10-24">St. Joseph</a> - Charles Souvay, The Catholic Encyclopedia.
