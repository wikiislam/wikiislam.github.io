<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="December_2004_Tsunami_caused_by_Indians.2C_Israelis_and_Americans">December 2004 Tsunami caused by Indians, Israelis and Americans</span></h3>
<p>Some Muslims believe that the December 26<sup>th</sup> tsunami was caused by Indians, Israelis and Americans (i.e. the Hindus, Jews, and Christians).
</p>
<div class="quotes">The earthquake that struck the Indian Ocean on December 26, triggering a series of huge waves called tsunami, &quot;was possibly&quot; caused by an Indian nuclear experiment in which &quot;Israeli and American nuclear experts participated,&quot; an Egyptian weekly magazine reported Thursday.
<p>According to Al-Osboa', India, in its heated nuclear race with Pakistan, has lately received sophisticated nuclear know-how from the United States and Israel, both of which &quot;showed readiness to cooperate with India in experiments to exterminate humankind.&quot;
</p><p>Since 1992, the magazine argued, leading geological centers in Britain, Turkey and other countries, warned of the need &quot;not to hold nuclear experiments in the region of the Indian Ocean known as 'the Fire Belt,' in which the epicenter of the earthquake lies.
</p><p>Geologists labeled that region 'The Fire Belt' for being &quot;a dangerous terrain that can move at anytime, without human intervention,&quot; Al-Osboa' wrote.
</p><p>Despite warnings not to carry out nuclear experiments in and around the 'Fire Belt', &quot;Israel and India continue to conduct nuclear tests in the Indian Ocean, and the United States has recently decided to carry out similar tests in the Australian deserts, which is included in the 'Fire Belt', the Egyptian weekly magazine wrote.
</p><p>&quot;Last year only, Arab and Islamic states have asked the United States to stop its nuclear activities in that region, and to urge Israel and India to follow suite,&quot; Al-Osboa' reported.
</p><p>Although Al-Osboa' does not rule out the possibility that the tsunami could have been caused by a natural earthquake it speculates however that, &quot;while it has not been proved yet, there has been a joint Israeli-Indian secret nuclear experiment [conducted on December 26] that caused the earthquake.&quot;
</p><p>The Egyptian weekly magazine concludes in its report that &quot;the exchange of nuclear experts between Israel and India, and US pressure on Pakistan which is exerted by supplying India with state-of-the-art nuclear technology and preventing Islamabad from cooperating with Asian and Islamic states in the nuclear field, pose a big question mark on the causes behind the violent Asian earthquake.&quot;
</p><p>Incitement against Israel and Jews in Egyptian media is usually limited to the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict yet exceptions are known to occur.
</p><p>In August 2002, the Paris Supreme Court summoned Ibrahim Naafi', editor of the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram, for having authorized the publication of a controversial article entitled 'Jewish matza is made from Arab blood' in the October 28, 2000 edition of the paper.
</p>
Naafi' was charged with incitement to anti-Semitism and racist violence.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2005/060105nuketest.htm&date=2011-06-06?url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2005/060105nuketest.htm&date=2011-06-06">&quot;Egyptian paper: Israel-India nuke test caused tsunami&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(a</span><span style="font-size:88%">rchived</span><span style="font-size:88%"> from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1104981578311?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1104981578311">the original</a>)</span><br>Joseph Nasr, Jerusalem Post, January 6 2005<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2005/060105nuketest.htm&date=2011-06-06?url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2005/060105nuketest.htm&date=2011-06-06">http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2005/060105nuketest.htm&amp;date=2011-06-06</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Egyptian+paper%3A+Israel-India+nuke+test+caused+tsunami&rft.atitle=&rft.aulast=Joseph+Nasr&rft.au=Joseph+Nasr&rft.date=January+6+2005&rft.pub=Jerusalem+Post&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webcitation.org%2Fquery%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.prisonplanet.com%2Farticles%2Fjanuary2005%2F060105nuketest.htm%26date%3D2011-06-06&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Muslim_Conspiracy_Theories"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Americans_lacing_polio_vaccines_with_anti-fertility_agent_to_sterilizes_Muslim_children">Americans lacing polio vaccines with anti-fertility agent to sterilizes Muslim children</span></h3>
<p>A variant of the previous conspiracy theory which has led to deadly consiquences.
</p>
<div class="quotes">A worldwide campaign begun in 1988 to eradicate the polio infection was on the verge of success when, early in 2003, a conspiracy theory took hold of the Muslim population in northern Nigeria. That conspiracy theory has single-handedly returned polio to epidemic proportions.
<p>The theory's source seems to be a physician and the president of Nigeria's Supreme Council for Shari'a Law, Ibrahim Datti Ahmed, 68. Dr. Ahmed, an Islamist, accuses Americans of lacing the vaccine with an anti-fertility agent that sterilizes children (or, in an alternate theory, it infects them with AIDS) and considers them, according to John Murphy of the Baltimore Sun, &quot;the worst criminals on Earth … Even Hitler was not as evil as that.&quot;
</p><p>This fear of polio vaccines caught on because of the war in Iraq, explained a doctor with the World Health Organization. &quot;If America is fighting people in the Middle East,&quot; goes the Islamist logic, &quot;the conclusion is that they are fighting Muslims.&quot; Local imams repeated and spread the sterilization theory, which won wide acceptance despite vocal assurances to the contrary from the WHO, the Nigerian government, and many Nigerian doctors and scientists.
</p><p>Ibrahim Shekarau, governor of Kano, one of the three Nigerian states that refused the polio vaccine, justified the decision not to vaccinate on the grounds that &quot;it is a lesser of two evils to sacrifice two, three, four, five, even ten children than allow hundreds of thousands or possibly millions of girl-children likely to be rendered infertile.&quot;<br>. . .<br>
By mid-2004 the conspiracy theory had jumped to India, where a health worker noted that in one slum, &quot;many poor and ignorant women regard the anti-polio drops as a deceptive strategy to control the birth rate.&quot; Such phobia about the West infecting Muslims with diseases is nothing new.<br>. . .<br>
The polio-vaccine conspiracy theory has had direct consequences: Sixteen countries where polio had been eradicated have in recent months reported outbreaks of the disease – twelve in Africa (Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Sudan, and Togo) and four in Asia (India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen). Yemen has had the largest polio outbreak, with more than 83 cases since April. The WHO calls this &quot;a major epidemic.&quot;
</p>
The common element, the New York Times notes, is that incidents of polio are now located &quot;almost exclusively in Muslim countries or regions.&quot; That's because, scientists hypothesize, the polio infection traveled from Nigeria in a uniquely Muslim way – via the hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, which took place in January 2005.

<div class="quotes">India has initiated a nation-wide vaccination programme.  But Pakistan, which has the second highest infection rate in the world, is still discussing compulsory vaccinations.<br>. . .<br>
<p>Pakistan’s ever growing religious right are convinced that vaccinations are part of a western conspiracy.  Campaigners have to battle rumours that vaccinations have been designed by western organizations to reduce Muslim populations.
</p><p>Himayat ul-Haq, runs a madrassa in the North- West Pakhtunkhwa, where people follow a strict form of Deobandi Islam.  He preaches that polio, like all endemic diseases are signs of God’s will and therefore anything blocking them are an insult to Allah: “We are all Muslim. We will do what Allah has said. God is the creator of all diseases. And he knows how to heal them”.<br>. . .<br>
Himayat ul-Haq doesn’t see why the West would be interested in helping Pakistan and continues to harbour his own suspicions voicing the belief common also amongst Islamic fundamentalists in Nigeria that polio vaccines were designed to keep Muslim populations down. 
</p>
“In Africa, the polio vaccination program was really a way of controlling the population. Why did the western world care about the population in Kenya? Because they were Muslims.  Why are we forced to take the vaccination when we don’t want to?”<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/conspiracy-rumours-keep-polio-alive-pakistan">Conspiracy rumours keep polio alive in Pakistan</a><br>Devi Boerema, RNW, February 16, 2011</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Is Israel targeting the Palestinian population in Gaza by distributing libido-increasing chewing gum in the Strip? A Hamas police spokesman in the Gaza Strip Islam Shahwan claimed Monday that Israeli intelligence operatives are attempting to &quot;destroy&quot; the young generation by distributing such materials in the coastal enclave. 
<p>Shahwan said that the police got their hands on gum that increases sexual desire that, according to him, reaches merchants in the Strip by way of the border crossings. According to him, a Palestinian drug dealer admitted that he sold products that increase sex drive. The dealer said that he received the materials from Israeli sources by way of the Karni crossing. 
</p><p>A number of suspects have been arrested.
</p><p>The affair was exposed when a Palestinian filed a complaint that his daughter chewed the aforementioned gum and experienced the dubious side effects.
</p><p>Shahwan even claimed that Israeli intelligence operatives encourage dealers in Gaza to distribute the gum for free. 
</p><p>&quot;The Israelis seek to destroy the Palestinians' social infrastructure with these products and to hurt the young generation by distributing drugs and sex stimulants,&quot; said Shahwan. 
</p><p>However, he noted that drugs reach the Gaza Strip by way of Rafah tunnels, and said that the police keep a close watch on the illegal activities going on in the tunnels between Gaza and Egypt.

This in order to completely destroy Egyptian reproduction abilities,&quot; Al-Ahram states.

<div class="quotes">Egypt’s peace accord with Israel is “a mark of shame upon the Egyptian people” and must be amended, a media adviser for Egypt’s Freedom and Justice Party, the political movement of Muslim Brotherhood, said Thursday.

“This agreement has been a heavy burden upon the Egyptian people, undermining Egypt’s sovereignty. It has even undermined projects for the development of the Sinai. Therefore, it is an unjust and unfair agreement, which has isolated Egypt from its Arab and Islamic environs, and from the pan-Arab effort to liberate the land of Palestine, and to support Palestinian resistance,” Subei said.
</p><p>Subei connected the peace agreement and Israel with “endemic diseases” in Egypt. “In addition, carcinogenic pesticides were imported from the Zionist entity, and Egyptian agriculture was made available to the Zionist entity. This led to the destruction of various sectors in Egypt.

<div class="quotes">The furious international row over the publication of cartoons satirising the prophet Muhammad intensified today when Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed it was an Israeli conspiracy motivated by anger over Hamas's win in the Palestinian elections.
<p>Iran today also announced it was suspending all trade and economic ties with Denmark in protest of the caricatures. The move came after the EU had warned Iran that boycotting Danish goods would place further strain on already frosty relations.
</p><p>Speaking to Iranian air force personnel, Ayatollah Khamenei said the cartoons were a scandal, particularly as they came &quot;from those who champion civilisation and free expression&quot;.
</p><p>&quot;The west condemns any denial of the Jewish Holocaust, but it permits the insult of Islamic sanctities,&quot; Ayatollah Khamenei said. The caricatures amounted to a &quot;conspiracy by Zionists who were angry because of the victory of Hamas,&quot; he said.
</p><p>Yesterday, hundreds of Iranians hurled stones and petrol bombs at the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran in protest against the cartoons. The Austrian mission was targeted as the country currently holds the EU presidency.
</p><p>A bestselling Iranian newspaper, Hamshari, announced it was retaliating by holding a competition to find the best images satirising the Holocaust. The move mirrors the exercise of the Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, whose publication of 12 images of Muhammad in September sparked the row.
</p><p>As Ayatollah Khamenei made his comments, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said diplomatic missions should be respected and a small, peaceful protest took place outside the Danish embassy.

<div class="quotes">A columnist for the Saudi Arabian daily newspaper Al-Riyadh has finally uncovered the cornerstone of the Jewish plot for world domination. It is Switzerland. Yes, the entire nation of Switzerland is apparently a Jewish plot.
<p>Writing on September 4, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/5703.htm&date=2011-10-18?url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/5703.htm&date=2011-10-18">Fahd 'Amr Al-Ahmadi</a> pointed out that over the past four centuries, Europe has experienced numerous major wars, and yet Switzerland sat there right in the middle completely unscathed. At the same time, Switzerland refused to join any major international alliances or organizations (it only became a UN member in 2002).
</p><p>The conclusion for Al-Ahmadi is simple: Switzerland must be the &quot;safe haven where the [Jews'] wealth can be guarded against the wars they themselves spark,&quot; a safe haven spoken of in the czarist blood libel The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
</p><p>For those in the West who naively believe that holocaust-enducing anti-Semitism is a thing of the past, blood libels such as The Protocols are actually an increasingly prominent part of political discourse in the Middle East. So much so that major Arab newspapers reference The Protocols as thought it were common knowledge fact that the Jews are planning a global takeover. And to them, it is.
</p>
Of course, Al-Ahmadi's reasoning ignores the subhuman treatment of the Jews throughout all those wars during which their wealth was supposedly piling up and being guarded in Switzerland. A sane person may wonder why such powerful and wealthy Jews, capable of turning a whole nation into their private assistant, did not use some of that money and power to protect themselves from expulsion, forced conversion, pogroms and genocide.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/News/tabid/178/nid/22974/language/en-US/Default.aspx&date=2011-10-18?url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/News/tabid/178/nid/22974/language/en-US/Default.aspx&date=2011-10-18">Saudi paper says Switzerland is a Jewish plot</a><br>Ryan Jones, Israel Today Magazine, October 10, 2011</div></div>

After presenting the U.S. state as &quot;the most important in America,&quot; he referred to &quot;its most important city,&quot; which according to him is San Jose. He then proceeded to offer the etymology of the city's name. He correctly explained that &quot;San&quot; means &quot;saint&quot;; but then the fantasies began: according to the cleric, &quot;Jose&quot; (pronounced ho-zay) is the Latin word and pronunciation for one of Shia Islam's most important figures, &quot;Hussein.&quot;

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jews_and_other_Zionists_behind_the_Boston_Bombings">Jews and other Zionists behind the Boston Bombings</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">In an article titled &quot;The Boston Explosions – Look For Jews&quot; on the Jordanian website Ammon News, Palestinian-born Jordanian journalist As'ad Al-'Azouni, known for his antisemitic articles, wrote that the Jews and the &quot;American right&quot; were behind the recent Boston bombing, just as they had been behind the attacks of 9/11. He claimed that the bombing was meant to prevent U.S. President Barack Obama from discharging his second term in office in peace<br>. . .<br>
<p>[we see that] the bombing of the [Twin] Towers was meant to embroil America in the Middle East, whereas the Boston bombing and its repercussions were meant to deter America from trying to pressure Israel to advance the peace process in the region.
</p><p>&quot;The most puzzling [point] in this context is that [former U.S. president George] Bush Jr. announced the identity of those who had perpetrated the September 11 attacks. He said they were members of Al-Qaeda and that he had their passports, which had been found in the ruins of the two towers. The fire that, as we know, had consumed steel… had not managed to burn these passports, thank God. President Obama, on the other hand, is cleverer than his predecessor and understands the rules of the game. He has not announced [the names of] the [Boston] perpetrators and has blamed nobody, and it has been said that the operation was a domestic one…
&quot;The terrorist bombing [that took place] during the Boston marathon, near the finish line, clearly bears Jewish fingerprints. It is a message to President Obama to stop messing with Israel. These explosions were probably not the first warning issued to President Obama, nor will they be the last, for they will not let him enjoy his second term in office, and have even decided to target him personally.
</p><p>&quot;According to American sources, one week before the marathon, Boston police officers began to train, with dogs, to put out fires in this area. These explosions are another link in the chain of bombings that America has witnessed in Oklahoma and elsewhere.
</p>
&quot;The Jews and their allies in the American right – who harbor intense hatred for anyone who isn't white and still regret that a black president occupies the White House – will not let President Obama discharge his second term in office without problems. The Jews, as usual, are impossible to make an alliance with. They have no loyalty towards those who have served them, and betrayal is in their nature.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/7137.htm&date=2013-04-19?url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/7137.htm&date=2013-04-19">Jordanian Journalist: The Jews And The American Right Are Behind Boston Bombing, Just As They Were Behind 9/11</a><br>MEMRI, Special Dispatch No.5278, April 18, 2013</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Following are excerpts from a Friday sermon delivered by Sheik Abd Al-Jalil Al-Karouri, which aired on April 19, 2013:
<p>Abd Al-Jalil Al-Karouri: The most important political events of the week were the Boston earthquake and the Texas earthquake, which joined it yesterday… Or rather, the bombings in Boston and in Texas, as well as the Iran earthquake. In short, the peculiar thing is that no one knows who is behind these events. Even President Obama said: &quot;We do not know who did this or why.&quot; Iran, too, does not know who caused the earthquake.
</p><p>[…]
People know who is responsible for earthquakes. It is God. But now there are allegations that this earthquake was artificial. The so-called &quot;earthquake-war&quot; has begun. The industrialized countries have the capacity to make bombs that impact the Earth’s crust and core, causing earthquakes. It is even said that the tsunami that raised the waves, causing thousands of deaths, was, in fact, an experiment in that weapon.
</p><p>[…]
</p><p>This earthquake had two goals: first, to [prevent] the Russians from officially handing over the Bushehr nuclear plant to Iran within a month’s time. The West does not want this to happen.
</p><p>[…]
They wanted to destroy the new gas pipeline [from Iran to Pakistan], along with the [Bushehr] nuclear plant. There is also the issue of promoting the sale of gas masks. These expired gas masks, meant to protect people from nuclear gases, have recently been sold in the Gulf. The fourth goal is to sow fear in the Gulf region, where the earthquakes were heard. They want to make these people scared of the Iranian nuclear plant, and to ignite a regional Sunni-Shiite war, a war between Iran and its neighbors.
</p><p>[…]
</p><p>To this we should add the bombings in America. Now they are saying that the bombs were placed in &quot;primitive&quot; pots. Why would anyone in the U.S. need to resort to nails and pressure cookers to make a bomb? You can find any type of weapon there and simply buy it. Why did they say &quot;primitive&quot;? I don’t have time to read you the quotation. They said that the bomb was &quot;primitive,&quot; in order to direct the blame at one of us in the Third World.
</p><p>[…]
</p><p>When North Korea stopped manufacturing buses, it started making nuclear warheads. Today, North Korea poses a threat to America. America might be drawn into an historic war, a war between Communism and capitalism. This is precisely what Israel does not want. Israel wants the war to be between America and the &quot;primitive&quot; Arabs, and that is why the bombs were &quot;primitive.&quot;
</p>
I have said that the [9/11] Manhattan bombings were meant to transform America from a country to an empire, and that it is, indeed, what happened. Now, they do not want this empire to expand, and to revive the Cold War – this time with North Korea and the Asian countries. No, they want America to continue to defend Israel.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.memri.org/clip_transcript/en/3813.htm&date=2013-05-16?url=http://www.memri.org/clip_transcript/en/3813.htm&date=2013-05-16">Sudan Friday Sermon: Israel Behind Boston Bombings, Iran Earthquake</a><br>MEMRI, Clip No. 3813, April 19, 2013</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Amid the protests and violence that have roiled Egypt in the past few days, a bizarre new anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish conspiracy theory has emerged claiming that the Muslim Brotherhood is tainted by a secret allegiance to Jews and Israel, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) revealed on Friday.
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a href="wiki/File-Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg.html" class="image"><img alt="" src="wiki/uploads/thumb/e/e9/Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg/200px-Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg" width="200" height="124" class="thumbimage" srcset="/wiki/uploads/thumb/e/e9/Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg/300px-Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/uploads/thumb/e/e9/Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg/400px-Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg 2x"></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="wiki/File-Morsi_a_secret_jew.jpg.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>In this poster, President Morsi is being accused of being both a pirate, and a Jew.</div></div></div>
<p>Protestors in Port Said, Egypt, were shown in a television broadcast chanting “Khaibar, Khaiber, oh Jews, the Brothers (Muslim Brotherhood) are the Jews.” The slogan evokes an alleged Islamic story of a battle between the prophet Muhammad and the Jews in the town of Khaibar, but in this case the chant was altered to include an allusion to the Brotherhood.
</p><p>Additionally, Dubai Police Chief Dahi Khalfan, in his Twitter campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood, has recently attempted to discredit the Brotherhood by alleging a nefarious allegiance to Israel and Jews.
</p><p>“It would seem that no allegation made against the Jews and Israel is too absurd when it is used to stigmatize and discredit others in the Arab world,” said Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director. “However bizarre and ludicrous, it is an increasingly popular conspiracy theory that the Muslim Brotherhood is a Jewish production to destroy Egyptians.”
</p><p>Chief Khalfan, who holds the rank of Lieutenant General, serves as member of the Executive Council of the Government of Dubai and has more than 300,000 followers on his Twitter account, which he devotes primarily to criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood.
</p>

<p>The belief that there is a &quot;conspiracy between the United States and the Muslim Brotherhood to destroy Egypt&quot; is common among Egyptians and was a widespread topic of conversation in Cairo in August 2013.
</p>
<div class="quotes">As patrons of the Red Apple Cafe ignored the new 9 p.m. curfew, the presence of an American elicited bountiful conspiracy theories, all of them involving America’s plan to destroy Egypt through its paid Brotherhood confederates.

<p>On Zaki Street, the cafes were full of smokers of shisha, the flavored tobacco burned in water pipes, and of backgammon players. Outside, the driver of a horse-drawn cart full of canisters of cooking gas clanged his cans to announce his presence, and Farouq, a middle-aged man making deliveries to supermarkets with a motorcycle-drawn cart, stopped to talk.
</p><p>“Americans are with the Muslim Brotherhood,” Farouq stated in a tone suggesting that it was common knowledge. “O.K., you did something good when you killed Osama bin Laden, but now you are with Al Qaeda. You support the terrorists.”
</p><p>A strong anti-American undercurrent has always existed in Egypt, but such views are more normally associated with radicals and Islamists, and in reaction to American support for Israel.
</p><p>But now anti-American sentiment is being stoked by an outpouring of dubious pronouncements from both state and private news media. Anti-Americanism has even been given the ultimate imprimatur of state tolerance: billboards. One next door to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for instance, shows President Obama with a beard like those worn by the Brotherhood, alongside a more flattering picture of the clean-shaven military leader, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi.

<p>A 2011 Pew survey found that 10 percent of US Muslims believe Barack Obama is a Muslim, and a further third say they do not know or refused to answer.
</p>
<div class="quotes">[Obama] is losing much of his 2008 base of voters with one notable exception: Muslim-Americans. They remain exceedingly loyal to the president. In fact, their enthusiasm for Obama has swelled.
<p>Last month, Pew Research Center released a survey of U.S. Muslims that was almost universally overlooked. It found that Muslims overwhelmingly approve of the way Obama is handling his job as president. Fully three-quarters (76%) favor him, compared with just 46% of the general public.

</p><p>President Bush, in contrast, garnered a lowly 15% approval rating among Muslim-Americans. &quot;Muslim-Americans clearly see a friend in Obama,&quot; Pew said in its report.
</p><p>Obama came into office pledging to improve relations with the Muslim world, and he's more than delivered on that promise. Almost two-thirds of U.S. Muslims say Obama is generally friendly toward them, Pew found. Just 4% see him as unfriendly.

Meanwhile Sa'da made clear that al-Gaddafi's grandmother was Jewish, and that she had married someone from the same religion.

</p><p>The Indian university conducted tests on the impact of drinking Pepsi and Coca Cola which proved that drinking them lead to more rapid heart rate and low pressure. Also drinking 6 bottles of Pepsi or Cola at a time causes instant death. It also contains chemicals such as carbonic and phosphoric acids, citric acid which harms teeth and causes bone fragility. Bones kept in the Cup of Pepsi melts during the week knowing that the bones of the dead remain in the grave for thirty years.

<div class="quotes">Last month mass hysteria apparently swept the capital city, Khartoum, after reports that foreigners were shaking hands with Sudanese men and causing their penises to disappear. One victim, a fabric merchant, told his story to the London Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi. A man from West Africa came into the shop and &quot;shook the store owner's hand powerfully until the owner felt his penis melt into his body.&quot;<br>. . .<br>
<p>Al-Quds reported, &quot;The store owner became hysterical, and was taken to the hospital.&quot; The country's &quot;Chief Criminal Attorney General&quot; Yasser Ahmad Muhammad told the Sudanese daily Al-Rai Al-A'am that &quot;the rumor broke out when one merchant went to another merchant to buy some Karkady [a Sudanese beverage]. Suddenly, the seller felt his penis shriveling.&quot;
</p><p>The invaluable Middle East Media Research Institute, in its exhaustive coverage, noted that the penises of Khartoum were vulnerable not merely to handshaking. &quot;Another victim, who refused to give his name, said that while he was at the market, a man approached him, gave him a comb, and asked him to comb his hair. When he did so, within seconds, he said, he felt a strange sensation and discovered that he had lost his penis.&quot;
</p>
Tales of the vanishing penises ran rampant round the city, spread by cell phones and text messages. Sudan's Attorney General Salah Abu Zayed declared that all complaints about the missing penises would be brought before a special investigative committee, though doctors had determined that the first plaintiff was &quot;perfectly healthy.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1003/steyn_2003_10_28.php3">Muslim paranoia: Enemies made us impotent!</a><br>Mark Steyn, Jewish World Review, October 28, 2003</div></div>

<p>Note that this conspiracy theory erroneously claims the &quot;Jewish Walt Disney Company gained international fame with this cartoon&quot;. Tom and Jerry is a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer creation and not a Disney cartoon.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Professor Hasan Bulkhari, a senior cultural adviser to Iran's Education Ministry, recently stated that the animated series 'Tom and Jerry' was created as part of a Jewish conspiracy.
<p>Bulkhari explained that the cartoon aimed at shifting the image of mice - often attributed to Jews by the Nazi regime - from a negative one to a more positive, friendly, intelligent one, according to Worldnetdaily. 
</p><p>Speaking on a televised program on Iranian television, the advisor explained, &quot;The mouse is the wise and smart one, and he violently beats the poor cat. 
</p><p>And yet, this cruelty does not cause you to despise the mouse. He looks so nice, and he is smart.&quot; 
</p><p>&quot;The Jews were degraded and termed 'dirty mice.' 'Tom and Jerry' was made in order to change the Europeans' perception of mice. One of terms used was 'dirty mice.'&quot;
</p><p>&quot;It should be noted that mice are very cunning ... and dirty.&quot; 
</p><p>&quot;The program was produced in an attempt to erase the image of the mouse from the minds of European children and to show that the mouse is not dirty and that he even has nice characteristics,&quot; he pointed out. 
</p><p>&quot;The Jewish Walt Disney Company gained international fame with this cartoon,&quot; he said. 
</p><p>&quot;If you study European history, you will see who was the main power in hoarding money and wealth in the 19th century,&quot; continued Bolkhari. &quot;In most cases, it is the Jews. Perhaps that was one of the reasons which caused Hitler to begin the anti-Semitic trend, and then the extensive propaganda about the crematoria began. ... Some of this is true. We do not deny all of it.&quot;
</p><p>Created in 1939 creation by Joe Barbera and Bill Hanna, the MGM series was launched as World War II began.

<div class="quotes">Ameer Karwani Islami, Maulana Ghulam Rasool Hami, has expressed serious concern over the alleged role of Christian missionaries in converting young Kashmiri Muslim boys and girls to Christianity.
<p>Addressing a gathering here on Sunday, Hami said some Christian missionaries were trying to alter the Muslim majority character of Jammu and Kashmir at the behest of America and Israel. “We ask Muslims who have fallen for the trap of these missionaries and converted to Christianity to present themselves before Ulema before Eid-ul-Azha, and seek repentance from Allah,” he said.
</p><p>“Otherwise, Karwani Islami and Darul-Ifta will convene a joint session of Ulema and Muftis on November 11 and issue a fatwa(decree) of  social boycott against these  converts,” Hami said.
</p><p>Hami said the Ulema will not remain silent over the activities of Christian missionaries. “ They are luring young Muslims with money to convert and we will go to any extent to stop their activities,” he said.
</p><p>Hami said, being a Muslim majority state, liquor should have been banned in Jammu and Kashmir. “Instead, the government under a well planned conspiracy is promoting liquor among youth ,” he said.
</p><p>Hami said it was ironic that the government had allowed a liquor shop opposite the Children’s hospital in Sonawar. “If the government doesn’t revoke the license of the liquor shop, Karwani-i-Islami would take to the streets,” he said.

<div class="quotes">Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas has accused Jews living in Judea and Samaria of training wild boars to uproot Arabs' trees. The fantastic claim is included in a quote from Abbas that appears in an official presentation on PA incitement presented Sunday to the Israeli cabinet.
<p>Abbas made the claim in a speech in Ramallah on the eve of his appearance at the United Nations in September, in which he asked for recognition of PA statehood. The speech went virtually unnoticed in the media, except for some vigilant blogs.
</p><p>&quot;The occupation and its actions, this is the nightmare that weighs down upon us,&quot; Abbas said. &quot;…Attacks by settlers that find their expression in uprooting trees, burning mosques and even training dogs to attack us and sending wild boars to spread corruption on the face of the earth.&quot;
</p><p>Abbas continued: &quot;The settlers deal with us in three ways: when they run across someone they attack him; they have trained the dogs well for this, and the boars, too, for uprooting trees.&quot;
</p><p>Just one week after Abbas gave his speech, a terror gang murdered Asher and Yonatan Palmer of Kiryat Arba.
</p><p>The Minister for Strategic Affairs, Moshe Yaalon, and Ministry Director Yossi Kupferwasser, presented the quotes as part of a report on the &quot;Incitement Index,&quot; which shows an upsurge in PA incitement against Israel in recent months.
</p><p>Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called the Index &quot;an important eye-opener and reminder regarding where we live.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;We have seen horrific things here,&quot; he said, &quot;that define the Jews as poisoners of wells, among other things, and prepare the hearts for harsh and cruel deeds.&quot;
</p><p>The Elder of Zion blog has found that the wild boar libel originated with reports that appeared on PA news sites. A 2010 report on the Palestine Press Agency claimed:
</p><p>&quot;Pigs from settlers from the settlement of 'Ariel' continued their attacks on the rights of farms and houses in Salfit and surrounding villages. Witnesses said that a swine herd consisting of twenty pigs attacked the farming communities, breaking down peach and apricot trees... Witnesses said the pigs made scary sounds and also attacked a field of wheat belonging to farmers Imran Ahmed Khalil Masri and Abu Dar.... The farmers expressed their indignation at the repeated attacks of pigs and have shown that attempts to eliminate them and get rid of them have failed dismally.&quot;
</p><p>Elder of Zion noted wryly that &quot;the evil Jews did not only train the pigs to distinguish between Arab and Jewish farmlands, but they also train them to make scary noises!&quot;

<div class="quotes">A report in a state-controlled Iranian paper last week asserting that the “Zionist regime” “spreads homosexuality” across the globe in order to pursue its goal of world domination has sparked fierce criticism from experts on Iran because of its homophobia and anti- Semitism.
<p>Mashregh News, an outlet affiliated with radical Islamists in Qom, wrote that the US and the UK are using money from Jews to spread homosexuality throughout the world. The article blasted Israel for promoting demonstrations for gay rights and specifically decried Tel Aviv as the gay paradise on earth. It also ridiculed Conservative Judaism for accepting gay rabbis, and urged Western governments to stop people from engaging in gay – and therefore immoral – actions, and provide medical treatment for homosexuals in order to stop their conduct.<br>. . .<br>
Dr. Wahied Wahdat-Hagh, an expert on minority groups in Iran, told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday that the article is “against gays, against the West and anti-Semitic.” He added that “the text legitimizes the execution of gays in Iran; they made a text not only to ridicule the West but to provide a reason why Iran executes gays.”
