<p>Muslims believe that the <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> contains a message from an all-powerful, all-knowing, infallible being. If this is true then it should not contain any <a href="wiki/Contradictions_and_Errors.html" title="Contradictions and Errors">errors, mistakes</a>, or information that contradicts known facts about the universe. If even one error exists in the text of <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>'s holy book then the claims of divine authorship and infallibility are not true. An objective evaluation of the Qur’an shows that it contains numerous <a href="wiki/Islam_and_Science.html" title="Islam and Science">scientific</a> and historical errors and it reflects a pre-scientific, 7<sup>th</sup> century view of the natural world.
</p><p>Some apologists will contest these numerous scientific errors in the Qur'an by appealing to metaphor, alternative meanings, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)" class="extiw" title="w:Phenomenology (philosophy)">phenomenological</a> interpretations of the text. Even if we suppose that alternative explanations were possible in every case, the wording and content of the Qur'anic verses often mimic the popular mythology and unscientific misconceptions of the time in which they were recorded. The author of the Qur’an makes no clear or unambiguous statements that differentiate his understanding of the natural world from the common folklore of the people living in the 7<sup>th</sup> century. If the Qur’an was delivered by an all-powerful, all-knowing being then he would have been able to foresee how such ambiguous and misleading statements would be understood by future generations and the doubts and confusions they would cause. This alone should be reason to reject any claims to its divine authorship.

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html" title="Geocentrism and the Quran">Geocentrism and the Qur'an</a></div>
<p>The Qur'an mentions numerous times that the sun and the moon travel in an orbit, but does not mention once that the earth does too. This is consistent with a earth-centered (geocentric) view of the cosmos that places a motionless earth at the center of the universe and all &quot;heavenly bodies&quot; travel around the earth. This was the prevailing understanding of the universe prior to the 16<sup>th</sup> century when Copernicus helped explain and popularize a sun-centered (heliocentric) view of the universe. Tellingly, the sun's orbit is always mentioned in the context of night and day.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<div class="quotes">
A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness. And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/036-qmt.php#036.037#036.037">36:37-38</a></div></div>
<p>This is in a passage about night and day. Right after describing the change from day to night, it says that the sun runs on to a resting place for it (a few translations use instead, &quot;appointed term&quot;, though in nearly all other verses where we find قرر as a participle they translate it as a place of settlement or an abode or resting place. There are also sahih hadith that mention the sun's daily cycle using the same Arabic word as in verse 36:38 to mean a resting place <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/001-smt.php#001.0297#001.0297">1:297</a> (for the Arabic of this hadith, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://sunnah.com/muslim/1/306">here</a>).
</p><p>The alternative view was that it refers to the sun's final resting on the last day. There are other verses (35:13, 31:29, 39:5, 13:2) that mention the sun and moon floating/swimming (with the same verb as is translated &quot;run&quot; in 36:38) for a term appointed (لِأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى which does have that meaning - مُسْتَقَرٍّ in 36:38 is a different word). Another version of the above mentioned hadith (e.g. <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/093-sbt.php#009.093.520#009.093.520">9:93:520</a> - for the Arabic see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://sunnah.com/bukhari/97/52">here</a>) probably supports this view, with a different ending indicating that the مُسْتَقَرٍّ (resting place) in 36:38 refers to the end of the world when the sun is asked to rise from its setting place (مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا). Whichever interpretation was intended, the sun's movement is nevertheless mentioned right after describing day and night, just as the next verse mentions the different mansions appointed for the moon each night. The whole passage is about day and night and the sun and moon's movement in that context.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<div class="quotes">
It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/036-qmt.php#036.040#036.040">36:40</a></div></div>
<p>Some apologists try to explain away the Qur'anic description of the sun moving in an orbit as a reference to our sun orbiting the black hole at the center of the milky way galaxy every 225 million years. This is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_hypothesis" class="extiw" title="w:Ad hoc hypothesis">Ad hoc hypothesis</a>, of no relevance to human time scales, and nothing from the text implies that the sun is orbiting anything other than the earth. If the author had knowledge of the sun orbiting a black hole then it is conspicuous that he never mentions it explicitly nor in any way differentiates the sun's orbit from that of the moon.
</p><p>In the Qur'an, the moon and the sun orbit the earth together. There is no distinction made between the moon, which actually revolves around the earth, and the sun which only appears to revolve around the earth when in fact the sun's apparent movement through the sky is a product of the rotation of the earth around its axis.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
By the Sun and his (glorious) splendour; By the Moon as she follows him; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/091-qmt.php#091.001#091.001">91:1-2</a>}</div></div>
<p>The Arabic word translated &quot;follow&quot; is primarily defined as to follow, go or walk behind, follow in way of immitation, of action etc. and is often used for animals like camels following behind each other. This is very much compatible with and suggestive of a worldview in which the moon and sun traverse the same or similar paths after one another, which is what a 7th century person might believe from observing the sky. The choice of word is not suggestive merely of appearing one after the other.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<div class="quotes">And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They float, each in an orbit.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/021-qmt.php#021.033#021.033">21:33</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Hast thou not seen how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and causeth the day to pass into the night, and hath subdued the sun and the moon (to do their work), each running unto an appointed term; and that Allah is Informed of what ye do?<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/031-qmt.php#031.029#031.029">31:29</a></div></div>
<p>Notice also that the path of the sun is something that the author expects people to have seen (another problem for the galactic orbit interpretation).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Setting_and_Rising_Place_of_the_Sun">Setting and Rising Place of the Sun</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Sun_Setting_in_a_Muddy_Spring.html" title="Dhul-Qarnayn and the Sun Setting in a Muddy Spring">Dhul-Qarnayn and the Sun Setting in a Muddy Spring</a></div>
<p>The Qur'an assumes a flat earth which has physical places into which the sun sets and rises from. Since the earth is a rotating sphere, the sun does not set in any particular place and you can never travel to &quot;the spot&quot; where the sun sets nor a place where it rises; the sun appears to set or rise on the horizon no matter where you are on the planet. In these verses, the author propagates a popular legend from the 7th century of a man named Dhu'l-Qarnayn who visits the places where the sun sets and rises; here he finds the sun going down into a muddy spring and later rising on a tribe with no coverings. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">
 Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a people thereabout. We said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Either punish or show them kindness. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/018-qmt.php#018.086#018.086">18:86</a></div></div>

<p>Some Muslim Apologists have come up with creative interpretations of these verses to say that Dhu'l-Qrnayn only traveled until he reached &quot;the west&quot; or to a spot &quot;at the time&quot; when the sun set and not the &quot;place&quot; where the sun set. Unfortunately, these alternative interpretations are severely undermined by the <a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Sun_Setting_in_a_Muddy_Spring_-_Part_One.html#First_interpretation:_He_reached_the_west_and_east" title="Dhul-Qarnayn and the Sun Setting in a Muddy Spring - Part One">context and Arabic words</a> used in these verses, which instead point to a physical location. Again, we must ask why an all-knowing being would use such misleading verses that mimic the misconceptions and legends prevalent at the time if one of these alternative explanations is correct.

<p>The author of the Qur'an does not seem to know the difference between stars (giant balls of gas thousands of times larger than the earth) and meteorites which are small rocky masses of debris which brighten up after entering the earth's atmosphere. Many ancient people confused the two, as meteorites look like stars that are streaking across the sky; this is why there were often called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid" class="extiw" title="w:Meteoroid">shooting stars</a> or falling stars. In the following verse, the Qur'an claims that Allah uses stars as missiles to ward away devils. This repeats a common Arab myth at the time the Qur'an was first recited.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And verily We have beautified the world's heaven with stars/lamps, and We have made them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/067-qmt.php#067.005#067.005">67:5</a></div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Moon_Emits_Light">Moon Emits Light</span></h3>
<p>The moon does not emit its own light but simply reflects light coming from the Sun. The Arabic word for reflected (in`ikaas) does not appear in this Qur'anic verse that says the Moon is a &quot;light&quot;. It instead uses the word &quot;Noor&quot; which is used to denote an entity that emits light.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And hath made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp?<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/071-qmt.php#071.016#071.016">71:16</a></div></div>
<p>The word &quot;Noor&quot; is also used in this verse to show that Allah is the &quot;light&quot; of the universe. Clearly the author is not implying that Allah reflects light from another source but is the source of the light.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
 Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light!

<p>The Qur'an and Hadith claim that the moon was miraculously split into two pieces and then, presumably, put back together again. There is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever that the moon has ever been split into two. Since the moon is visible to half the planet at any given time, we should expect to see numerous accounts from different parts of the world attesting to this event if it actually happened. The Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Persians, Chinese and Indians had avid astronomers who should have seen this event and recorded it in their histories. The absence of historical record from other civilizations, contemporary to Muhammad, is a strong indication that this event never happened.

<p>The earth first formed around 9 billion years after the Big Bang. The Qur'an, however, repeats the prevailing middle eastern myth that the earth and universe were formed in six days. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">
We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in Six Days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/050-qmt.php#050.038#050.038">50:38</a></div></div>
<p>Muslim apologists try and rescue the Qur'an by pointing to an alternative meaning of the Arabic word 'yawm' which typically means 'day' but can sometimes mean 'time period'. However the predominant meaning of the word is day and when a specific number is used, in this case six, the word almost always means a literal 24-hour day. Again, nothing in the context of the verses, nor the Qur'an in general, suggests the universe or earth were formed over long time periods. Secondly, neither the universe nor earth were formed in six long periods of time. It would have been trivial for an all-knowing diety to simply state that the universe was first formed over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" class="extiw" title="w:Age of the universe">13.8 billion years ago</a>. However, this information is conspicuously missing.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Earth_Created_before_Stars">Earth Created before Stars</span></h3>
<p>The author of the Qur'an is also unaware that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust" class="extiw" title="w:Abundance of elements in Earth's crust">elements in the Earth's crust</a> and core were first formed in stars. Modern science has proposed that all the elements that make up the earth (Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon, Iron, etc.) was originally formed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis" class="extiw" title="w:Nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> in stars and then expelled into the universe when those stars <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova" class="extiw" title="w:Supernova">supernova</a>. Yet the Qur'an describes the earth being formed before the stars and from &quot;smoke&quot; or material that pre-dates stars. All rocky and gaseous planets in the universe were formed in a similar manner to the earth and the Qur'an singling out the earth only further highlights the authors ignorance of the history of the formation of celestial objects.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Earth_and_Heavens_were_Ripped_Apart">Earth and Heavens were Ripped Apart</span></h4>
<p>Some apologists claim that the following verse is compatible with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang" class="extiw" title="w:Big Bang">Big Bang</a> theory. But according to this theory, the Universe was formed about 13.8 billion years ago due to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe" class="extiw" title="w:Chronology of the universe">rapid expansion</a> from singularity. The earth was formed 4.54 billion years ago from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Earth" class="extiw" title="w:History of the Earth">accretion</a> of debris that surrounded the precursor of the Sun. There was no &quot;separation&quot; of the &quot;joined&quot; earth and heavens as this verse suggests. It is, in fact, a repetition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_egg" class="extiw" title="w:World egg">cosmic egg</a> myths in which an egg-like structure was split into two halves, the lower half forming the earth and the upper half forming the heaven.
</p>
<div class="quotes">

<p>Neither was there any stage of formation of the Universe that involved smoke (carbon particles suspended as a result of combustion) nor did the earth and heavens &quot;come&quot; together at any point of time. Earth is a part of this Universe and has developed within it.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth. They said: We come, obedient. Then He ordained them seven heavens in two Days and inspired in each heaven its mandate; and We decked the nether heaven with lamps, and rendered it inviolable. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Knower. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/041-qmt.php#041.011#041.011">41:11-12</a></div></div>
<p>The next verse clearly says that stars were created after the seven heavens which took two days to create, and after the earth which was created even earlier.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Cause_of_Shadows">The Cause of Shadows</span></h3>
<p>Shadows are produced when the sun's light is blocked by an obstacle. It is the Earth's rotation that causes these shadows to change size and location. However, by calling the sun the guide of shadows, this verse claims shadows are caused due to the sun's movement. A non-living &quot;guide&quot; can have two meanings: a controller of movement or an indicator. Other translations of this verse do call the sun an indicator but this is also unscientific because the sun cannot <i>indicate</i> them.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its guide; Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/025-qmt.php#025.0045-46#025.0045-46">25:45-46</a></div></div>
<p>Further, this verse suggests that shadows can be made stationary i.e. the rotation of the earth can be stopped. This is not possible. Then the next verse says that shadows are drawn towards Allah which has no scientific meaning.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sun_is_a_Flat_Disk">Sun is a Flat Disk</span></h3>
<p>This verse suggests that the Sun is flat and can be folded up. The Sun appears as a flat disc from the perspective of a person on earth, but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" class="extiw" title="w:Sun">sun</a> is in fact a near-perfect sphere (oblate spheroid). The verse implies the authors ignorance of this fact.
</p>

<p>The Qur'an has statements about the end of the world that are much as one would expect if the author believed the sun and moon to be of similar size and a similar distance from Earth.
</p>
<div class="quotes">And the moon darkens And the sun and the moon are joined,<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/075-qmt.php#075.008#075.008">75:8-9</a></div></div>
<p>The word translated &quot;are joined&quot; is Arabic jumi'a, a verb which means to collect together, gather together, bring together. Given that this would actually require the moon to travel 98 million miles away from Earth and into the sun, which dwarfs it by over 600 times in diameter, it seems vastly less fitting as an apocalyptic event than if the ancient conception of the cosmos was correct.

<p>A common myth at the time of the Quran's composition was that the sky or heavens were held up with pillars. Many Bedouin people living in Arabia imagined the sky as a large tent covering, similar to the tents they used. The author repeats this myth by describing the sky as being &quot;raised&quot; above the earth.

<p>In polar regions, the longevity of day and night vary during summer and winter. The day gets shorter and shorter in winter until there are days or weeks of uninterrupted night. At the poles themselves, day and night alternately last for six months and all phases of the moon occur several times between sunrise and sunset. The author of the Qur'an did not know about this and he only repeated earlier geocentric ideas.

<p>The author of the Qur'an describes the formation of a human embryo from fluids emanating from the man (and possibly also of the woman). This reflects the contemporary, but incorrect, view that the embryo is initially formed out of semen stored in the womb. In fact, semen is the vehicle for the sperm cells, one of which fuses with a woman's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ovum" class="extiw" title="w:ovum">ovum</a> in her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallopian_tube" class="extiw" title="w:fallopian tube">fallopian tube</a>, and the resulting cell divides and travels back into the womb for implantation. While English translations mention a &quot;drop of seed&quot;, or &quot;drop of sperm&quot;, the Arabic word in question literally means a small amount of liquid, a euphemism for semen.

<p>The Qur'an's author did not mention the role of the ovum in human reproduction and appears to have no knowledge of it. This verse fails to mention the important role of the female egg, or ovum, plays in the reproduction of humankind. It implies that reproduction is caused simply by the male semen. The human ovum is very small, though visible to the human eye, and it's purpose wasn't understood in the 7th century. Again, we are left wondering why an all-knowing deity would omit such information.

<p>The Qur'an states that milk is produced, in the body, somewhere between excretions and blood. The mammary glands, where milk is produced and stored, are nowhere near the intestines which is where excrement is stored.

A significant number of  humans are <a href="wiki/Qur'an_and_Milk.html" title="Qur'an and Milk">lactose intolerant</a> and unable to digest milk without experiencing abdominal bloating and cramps, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.

<p>The author of the Qur'an was apparently unfamiliar with the polar regions in which there are six months of sunlight and six months of perpetual night during winter and summer. The Qur'an claims that Muslims should fast from sunrise till sunset, however this is arguably not observable by anyone living in the polar regions.

<p>A similar issue exists for the five daily prayers. Anyone living in the polar region would not be able to make a sunset or sunrise prayer all year round. Even for cities further south like Aberdeen in Scotland, the gap between the night prayer (Isha) and the dawn prayer (Fajr) is around 4 and a half hours in June, so anyone following these rules has to interupt their sleep around 3.20am, then go back to sleep before getting up for the day. Such issues would not have crossed the mind of a 7th century man in Arabia, who believed that everyone experiences sunrise and sunset when he does, and where it would be perfectly natural to arise at dawn any time of the year.

<p>The Qu'ran states that the first humans &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; spoke to each other in some kind of advanced language in many suras, and also that God told them the names of everything. Thanks to the modern field of linguistics and the history of language we know that the type of sentences constructed in the Qu'ran would simply not have been able to be spoken by humans until over 100,000 years since the first humans evolved. The language of the first humans would be incomprehensible to us and they would not be able to express the kinds of sentences that Adam and Eve do in the Qu'ran.

<p>4.11: Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases ('s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Al-wise. 
</p>
4.12: In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one).
