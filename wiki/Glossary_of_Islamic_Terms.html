Both Alaha and Yah find an ancestor in the Egyptian Yah (Iah or Lah: the moon proper). To reject al-Ilah (Allah) or to assign partners with him (see <a href="w/index.php.html?title=Shirk&action=edit&redlink=1" class="new" title="Shirk (page does not exist)">shirk</a>) is considered the greatest of sins.
