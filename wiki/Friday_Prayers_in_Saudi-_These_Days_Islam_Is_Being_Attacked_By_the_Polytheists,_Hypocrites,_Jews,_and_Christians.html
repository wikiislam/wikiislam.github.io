<p>Friday sermon (March 25, 2011) translated from the website of Saudi Shaykh Salih bin Fawzan bin 'Abdallah al-Fawzan, a member of the Saudi Council of Senior Scholars.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allah, who sent His Messenger with guidance, and the religion of truth, to manifest all of it in the religion, with Allah as its witness. I testify that there is no god but Allah alone. He has no associate. I testify that Muhammad is His slave and messenger; peace be upon him, as well as his family and companions. 
<p>O people, fear Almighty Allah, and thank him for the blessing of Islam. Ask him to confirm it upon you, for <b>in these days Islam is being attacked by the polytheists, hypocrites, Jews and Christians. They want to shake it and change it, and divide the Muslims. This is not a strange behavior from the enemies of Allah and His Messenger, for they have behaved this way in every time and place</b>, with all of the messengers, but especially with our prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). You know what happened to the messenger (peace be upon him) when he was in Mecca, for he and those Muslims with him suffered injustice at the hands of the polytheists. They attacked the Messenger (peace be upon him) and spread lies about him. They said that he was a magician, or a poet, or insane. They said that the Qur'an contained only the fables of the ancients, and poetry, and so on. This was their position on the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the Qur'an. Now their position on the Muslims in Mecca is well-known. They persecuted, attacked, beat, and tortured the weak and humble, in order to turn them away from Islam, for Allah had confirmed the truth of it for them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) remained in Mecca for 13 years in this situation with the infidels and polytheists, after which Allah Almighty permitted him to emigrate, at which point he found the Ansar, and a home which sheltered them, which is Medina. They wanted to prevent him and his companions from emigrating, fearing that they would grow strong and establish their state. So the Muslims slipped out and emigrated in secret, while the Messenger (peace be upon him) remained behind in Mecca, until Allah permitted him to emigrate as well. Then the polytheists met together and consulted on what they should do with the Messenger (peace be upon him), to keep him from joining his companions. So they consulted with each other, and considered three ideas: first, they would kill him and be done with him; second, they would throw him in prison for life so that he would die in prison; or third, they would drive him out of the country. They settled on the first option, which was to kill him. ... 
</p><p>When (Muhammad) reached Medina, he found a home, and the Ansar. However, <b>the wickedness of the polytheists, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites did not cease. Three enemies gathered against the Messenger (peace be upon him):  the polytheists disbelieved in his religion because they disbelieved in all religions; the Jews knew that he was the Messenger of Allah and that the Qur'an was true, but their jealousy led them to display unbelief and hostility towards him; and the hypocrites outwardly displayed acceptance of Islam in order to save their lives and property, and live with the Muslims, while inwardly they disbelieved, and were with the infidels</b>. The polytheists launched several raids against the Messenger (peace be upon him) several times to kill him, his religion, and his followers. They achieved what they achieved in the first battle, and in the battle of the trench, in the battle of hunayn, but Islam remained strong, and the Muslims remained. Those who were wounded were wounded in the path of Allah, and those who were martyred were martyred to the Garden. When the polytheists, Jews, and hypocrites saw that they could not destroy Islam, they continued to scheme against it, as is told us in the Qur'an. But the revelation continued to come down to the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Qur'an was sent down, Islam grew, and <b>the Messenger was victorious in his raids, until Allah permitted him to conquer Mecca. For he raided Mecca during Ramadan with the soldiers of Islam, and entered it victoriously. Allah conquered Mecca by his hands, and the people subsequently entered the religion of Allah in droves, and delegations came from everywhere</b>. The delegations came from tribes, declaring Islam and pledging allegiance to the Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah Almighty said, in the name Allah most merciful and gracious:  &quot;When comes the Help of Allah, and Victory, and thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds, celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy)&quot; [Qur'an 110:1-3]. This was sounded nearby on his behalf (peace be upon him), because he fulfilled the mission which was given to him, and Allah had fulfilled this religion, for he sent down to him while he was standing on Arafat, the saying:  &quot;This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&quot; [Qur'an 5:3]. 
</p><p>After that he lived for two months and a few days and then passed away (peace be upon him). When he passed away the polytheists were able to attack Islam, and some apostatized. They said, &quot;If he were a prophet he would not have died.&quot; They prevented one of the peoples from paying Zakat, and said, &quot;We owe this to the Messenger (peace be upon him). But since he died, now we don't owe it to anyone.&quot; The Muslims pledged allegiance to Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him). <b>He took a strong position, as firm and immovable as a mountain, and fought against the apostates, until Allah extinguished their wickedness, made his religion victorious, and exalted his word</b>. Islam was strengthened during the reign of Abu-Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him). After him came his brethren the caliphs, and Islam spread to the east and the west during the reign of 'Umar bin al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). Islam spread to the east and the west, confirming the word of the Almighty:  &quot;He it is Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion, that He may make it overcome the religions, all of them, though the polytheists may be averse&quot; [Qur'an 61:9]. 
</p><p><b>Allah made this Islam victorious, and made it overcome all of the other religions, and take power over most of the globe</b>. This is the victory of Almighty Allah. It cannot be harmed by the plots of the plotters, or the hatred of the hypocrites, and the polytheists, Jews, and Christians. That will not harm it. The Jews plotted against Islam. The Shi'a and Kharijite sects also secretly plotted. They achieved what they achieved, but Islam was not affected by it. The Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali bin Abu-Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) was killed by those wicked murderers. He was killed by the Kharijites, and the Shiites disgraced Allah. But Islam was victorious, to Allah be the praise. Islam will continue to be victorious until the Hour of Judgment, for Allah has covenanted to preserve it, and make it victorious. No one will be able to behave arrogantly towards it. 
</p><p>Then came the Tatars at the end of the 'Abbasid caliphate, and did what they did with the Muslims, killing thousands upon thousands of them. Nevertheless Islam remained and was not harmed, praise Allah. Then came the wars of the Crusaders, who raided the land of the Muslims. Allah made the Muslims victorious at the end of their reign, by the hand of the righteous caliph Salah al-Din al-Ayubi (may Allah have mercy on him). For he drove them out of Jerusalem and it returned to the hands of the Muslims. Thus Islam continues to achieve victory after victory, no matter what its enemies attempt. Now, as you know, they're trying to shake Islam, divide the Muslims, dissolve their countries, and occupy their lands. They would like to do this, but Allah will only allow his religion to be victorious, and his word to be exalted. <b>They say this is freedom, this is democracy, this is human rights, and so forth. They say this and advocate it, and encourage demonstrations, and vigils. But Allah be praised for the inhabitants of this country, and for its scholars and rulers, for they have stood firm before this fitna, for they did not give their enemies anything that they wanted</b>. 
</p>
We ask Allah Almighty to confirm us in our religion, and to let our enemies fail. We ask Him to make His religion victorious, and exalt His word. I seek refuge from Allah from the accursed Satan:  &quot;Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden (of bliss) without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: &quot;When (will come) the help of Allah?&quot; Ah! Verily, the help of Allah is (always) near!&quot; [Qur'an 2:214].<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.alfawzan.ws/node/13310&date=2011-04-07?url=http://www.alfawzan.ws/node/13310&date=2011-04-07">Islam Is and Will Be a Great and Lofty Religion Until the Hour of Judgment</a><br>alfawzan.ws, March 25, 2011</div></div>
