<div class="quotes">El-Faqi, an ex-Imam and lawyer, was imprisoned in March 1998 following his conversion to Christianity. He is slowly becoming a problem for the Islamic government: many people have become Christians as a result of his testimony, and the government don't know what to do with him. The 'Christian Imam' has been transferred from one jail to another, but every time, the same thing happened: he told his fellow prisoners about Jesus, and has started 'jail churches' in all of the prisons he has been in, according to a recent report.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jesus.org.uk/dawn/1999/dawn9912.html#Sudan#Sudan">Sudan: Ex-Imam starts 'jail churches'</a><br>DAWN Fridayfax, 1999</div></div>

<div class="quotes">A Sudanese student who converted from Islam to Christianity was severely beaten and tortured by security police in Khartoum two weeks ago, apparently at his own family's instigation.
<p>Mohammed Saeed Mohammed Omer Omer confirmed to Compass today that his uncle had threatened to kill him on September 19, just three days before he was arrested off a Khartoum street.
</p><p>Omer's family had become determined to force the young convert to stop attending church and meeting with Christians, a local Christian said. Security officials picked him up on September 22, as he was returning from a personal discipleship appointment with a local pastor.
</p><p>&quot;He was tortured and beaten,&quot; the source said, &quot;and he lost three fingernails pulled out with pliers.&quot; The convert reportedly was forced by security police to sign papers promising not to attend any church or Christian gatherings again.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
After his uncle's death threat, Omer moved away from home to live with a friend. But since his arrest and torture, he remains under virtual house arrest by his family, who try to monitor his telephone calls and limit his use of the Internet.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.worthynews.com/1901-sudanese-police-torture-convert-student">Sudanese Police Torture Convert Student</a><br>Barbara G.

<p>She decided to run for refuge to her older brother, Nur Bubkier – who, having been informed of her conversion, responded by thoroughly beating her and trying to knife her. 
</p><p>Two Christians from the Sudanese Church of Christ, Maria Mohamud and a church deacon, managed to rescue her from the violence, but Halima Bubkier was jailed for three days at a police station, she said, on the false charge of “disrespecting Islam.” During that time Mohamud took care of her 2-year-old baby.<br>. . .<br>
In Sahafa, five kilometers (three miles) south of Khartoum, another woman who left Islam is under a kind of house arrest by her family members for converting to Christianity.

“She cannot receive calls,” Mostafh said. “Her brother forbids her from moving outside the homestead or even attending [St. Peter and Paul Catholic] church” in Amarat, Khartoum.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.compassdirect.org/english/country/sudan/2992/">Converts from Islam Struggle to Survive</a><br>Compass Direct, April 13, 2009</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Christian refugees have been attacked by Islamic forces incuding in Darfur Region in northwestern Sudan, where evangelist Hawa Abdalla Muhammad Saleh was reportedly detained on May 9.
<p>Authorities have accused her of owning and distributing Bibles to others in the Abu Shouk camp for Internally Displaced Persons in Al-Fashir, capital of North Darfur state, Christians said.
</p><p>The evangelist was reportedly moved to the capital Khartoum by security agents and could be tried for apostasy, which carries the death sentence in northern Sudan, according to Christians with close knowledge about the situation. She was allegedly already tortured for six days in 2009.
</p><p>Elsewhere in Khartoum, a Christian mother of a 2-month-old baby was recovering of her injuries Wednesday, May 25, and remained destitute after she and her husband were attacked for leaving Islam for Christianity.
</p><p>Omar Hassan and Amouna Ahamdi, both 27, said knife-wielding, masked assailants on May 4 attacked them after relatives learned that they had converted from Islam to Christianity.
</p><p>Hassan told Compass Direct News agency that he and his wife were renting a house from her uncle in Khartoum, but he ordered them to leave after learning they had left Islam.
</p><p>They earlier fled Nyala, 120 kilometers (75 miles) southwest of El-Fashir, for Khartoum in June 2010.  In the latest attack, a knife pierced the palm of Ahamdi, who said her brother had already stabbed her three times in the stomach nine months ago, seriously injuring her spleen, after she told him she had become a Christian.
</p>
In the violent outburst, her brother reportedly also broke her left leg.

<div class="quotes">The Sudanese authorities are tracking down converts from Islam in their latest bid to rid the country of Christianity; they threatened to kill one Christian for refusing to divulge names.<br>. . .<br>
<p>A Christian from the Nuba Mountains who fled Sudan last month has now revealed how the authorities are trying to track down converts from Islam.
He was arrested in a raid on his home in Khartoum on 23 February and taken in for interrogation. Officials from the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) told the Christian, “If you need your life, just cooperate with us.”
His computer, two laptops, iPad, mobile phone, passport and other documents were confiscated, along with his brother and sisters’ mobile phones.  
The security officers accused the Christian of being a spy for insurgents in the Nuba Mountains, against whom Sudan has been waging a ferocious military campaign for two years, and threatened to kill him in accordance with Sudanese law.
He was released but ordered to report to the NISS office daily. He told Morning Star News before fleeing the country:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>They told me I must cooperate with them in giving them the names of Muslims who have changed their religion, and they asked me about the whereabouts of my friend, a guy who was a Muslim and became Christian.</i>  </dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>I am now threatened badly before them, and they were making me every day to be in their office, saying if I refused to deal with them, they will accuse me with unknown fate.</i></dd></dl>
<p>Persecution of Christians in Sudan, which is 98% Muslim, has increased sharply since the secession of the predominantly Christian South Sudan. Churches are being demolished, Christian institutions and schools closed, Christians arrested, foreign Christian workers deported and literature seized. In April, a government minister announced that no new licences will be granted for church buildings.
</p>
On 25 June, plain-clothes police officials raided the offices of the Sudan Presbyterian Evangelical Church, chasing pastors and others out, in an apparent bid to take over the property. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://barnabasfund.org/US/Converts-to-Christianity-endangered-in-Sudanese-crackdown.html">&quot;Converts to Christianity endangered in Sudanese crackdown&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbarnabasfund.org%2FUS%2FConverts-to-Christianity-endangered-in-Sudanese-crackdown.html&date=2013-08-22?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbarnabasfund.org%2FUS%2FConverts-to-Christianity-endangered-in-Sudanese-crackdown.html&date=2013-08-22">archived</a>)</span><br> Barnabas Fund, July 24, 2013<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://barnabasfund.org/US/Converts-to-Christianity-endangered-in-Sudanese-crackdown.html">http://barnabasfund.org/US/Converts-to-Christianity-endangered-in-Sudanese-crackdown.html</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Converts+to+Christianity+endangered+in+Sudanese+crackdown&rft.atitle=&rft.date=July+24%2C+2013&rft.pub=Barnabas+Fund&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fbarnabasfund.org%2FUS%2FConverts-to-Christianity-endangered-in-Sudanese-crackdown.html&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Ex-Muslims_(Sudan)"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
