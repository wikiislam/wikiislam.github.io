A Book revealed unto thee,- So let thy heart be oppressed no more by any difficulty on that account,- that with it thou mightest warn (the erring) and teach the Believers).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:3"> <sup>3</sup></span>
Follow (O men!) the revelation given unto you from your Lord, and follow not, as friends or protectors, other than Him. Little it is ye remember of admonition.

How many towns have We destroyed (for their sins)? Our punishment took them on a sudden by night or while they slept for their afternoon rest.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:5"> <sup>5</sup></span>
When (thus) Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this: &quot;Indeed we did wrong.&quot;

Then shall we question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom We sent it.

The balance that day will be true (to nicety): those whose scale (of good) will be heavy, will prosper:

Those whose scale will be light, will be their souls in perdition, for that they wrongfully treated Our signs.

It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth, and provided you therein with means for the fulfilment of your life: small are the thanks that ye give!

Then began Satan to whisper suggestions to them, bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them (before): he said: &quot;Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever.&quot;

Then (Moses) threw his rod, and behold! it was a serpent, plain (for all to see)!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:108"> <sup>108</sup></span>
And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white to all beholders!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:109"> <sup>109</sup></span>
Said the Chiefs of the people of Pharaoh: &quot;This is indeed a sorcerer well- versed.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:110"> <sup>110</sup></span>
&quot;His plan is to get you out of your land: then what is it ye counsel?&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:111"> <sup>111</sup></span>
They said: &quot;Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while); and send to the cities men to collect-
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:112"> <sup>112</sup></span>
And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:113"> <sup>113</sup></span>
So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh: They said, &quot;of course we shall have a (suitable) reward if we win!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:114"> <sup>114</sup></span>
He said: &quot;Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts) nearest (to my person).&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:115"> <sup>115</sup></span>
They said: &quot;O Moses! wilt thou throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw?&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:116"> <sup>116</sup></span>
Said Moses: &quot;Throw ye (first).&quot; So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat of) magic.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:117"> <sup>117</sup></span>
We put it into Moses's mind by inspiration: &quot;Throw (now) thy rod&quot;:and behold! it swallows up straight away all the falsehoods which they fake!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:118"> <sup>118</sup></span>
Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:119"> <sup>119</sup></span>
So the (great ones) were vanquished there and then, and were made to look small.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:120"> <sup>120</sup></span>
But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:121"> <sup>121</sup></span>
Saying: &quot;We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,-
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:122"> <sup>122</sup></span>
&quot;The Lord of Moses and Aaron.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:123"> <sup>123</sup></span>
Said Pharaoh: &quot;Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people: but soon shall ye know (the consequences).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:124"> <sup>124</sup></span>
&quot;Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on apposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:125"> <sup>125</sup></span>
They said: &quot;For us, We are but sent back unto our Lord:
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:126"> <sup>126</sup></span>
&quot;But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the Signs of our Lord when they reached us! Our Lord! pour out on us patience and constancy, and take our souls unto thee as Muslims (who bow to thy will)!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:127"> <sup>127</sup></span>
Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people: &quot;Wilt thou leave Moses and his people, to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?&quot; He said: &quot;Their male children will we slay; (only) their females will we save alive; and we have over them (power) irresistible.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:128"> <sup>128</sup></span>
Said Moses to his people: &quot;Pray for help from Allah, and (wait) in patience and constancy: for the earth is Allah's, to give as a heritage to such of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is (best) for the righteous.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:129"> <sup>129</sup></span>
They said: &quot;We have had (nothing but) trouble, both before and after thou camest to us.&quot; He said: &quot;It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may try you by your deeds.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:130"> <sup>130</sup></span>
We punished the people of Pharaoh with years (of droughts) and shortness of crops; that they might receive admonition.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:131"> <sup>131</sup></span>
But when good (times) came, they said, &quot;This is due to us;&quot; When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah's sight, but most of them do not understand!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:132"> <sup>132</sup></span>
They said (to Moses): &quot;Whatever be the Signs thou bringest, to work therewith thy sorcery on us, we shall never believe in thee.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:133"> <sup>133</sup></span>
So We sent (plagues) on them: Wholesale death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, And Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance,- a people given to sin.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:134"> <sup>134</sup></span>
Every time the penalty fell on them, they said: &quot;O Moses! on your behalf call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove the penalty from us, we shall truly believe in thee, and we shall send away the Children of Israel with thee.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:135"> <sup>135</sup></span>
But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil,- Behold! they broke their word!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:136"> <sup>136</sup></span>
So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:137"> <sup>137</sup></span>
And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of lands in both east and west, - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings. The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy, and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected (with such pride).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:138"> <sup>138</sup></span>
We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had. They said: &quot;O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have.&quot; He said: &quot;Surely ye are a people without knowledge.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:139"> <sup>139</sup></span>
&quot;As to these folk,- the cult they are in is (but) a fragment of a ruin, and vain is the (worship) which they practise.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:140"> <sup>140</sup></span>
He said: &quot;Shall I seek for you a god other than the (true) Allah, when it is Allah Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations?&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:141"> <sup>141</sup></span>
And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your females: in that was a momentous trial from your Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:142"> <sup>142</sup></span>
We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): &quot;Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:143"> <sup>143</sup></span>
When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him, He said: &quot;O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon thee.&quot; Allah said: &quot;By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me.&quot; When his Lord manifested His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust. And Moses fell down in a swoon. When he recovered his senses he said: &quot;Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn in repentance, and I am the first to believe.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:144"> <sup>144</sup></span>
((Allah)) said: &quot;O Moses! I have chosen thee above (other) men, by the mission I (have given thee) and the words I (have spoken to thee): take then the (revelation) which I give thee, and be of those who give thanks.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:145"> <sup>145</sup></span>
And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, (and said): &quot;Take and hold these with firmness, and enjoin thy people to hold fast by the best in the precepts: soon shall I show you the homes of the wicked,- (How they lie desolate).&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:146"> <sup>146</sup></span>
Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will adopt. For they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:147"> <sup>147</sup></span>
Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter,- vain are their deeds: Can they expect to be rewarded except as they have wrought?
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:148"> <sup>148</sup></span>
The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image of calf, (for worship): it seemed to low: did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:149"> <sup>149</sup></span>
When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: &quot;If our Lord have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be of those who perish.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:150"> <sup>150</sup></span>
When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: &quot;Evil it is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring on the judgment of your Lord?&quot; He put down the tablets, seized his brother by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him. Aaron said: &quot;Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught, and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune, nor count thou me amongst the people of sin.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:151"> <sup>151</sup></span>
Moses prayed: &quot;O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy! for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:152"> <sup>152</sup></span>
Those who took the calf (for worship) will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those who invent (falsehoods).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:153"> <sup>153</sup></span>
But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and (truly) believe,- verily thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:154"> <sup>154</sup></span>
When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing thereon was guidance and Mercy for such as fear their Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:155"> <sup>155</sup></span>
And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: &quot;O my Lord! if it had been Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou leadest whom Thou wilt into the right path. Thou art our Protector: so forgive us and give us Thy mercy; for Thou art the best of those who forgive.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:156"> <sup>156</sup></span>
&quot;And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter: for we have turned unto Thee.&quot; He said: &quot;With My punishment I visit whom I will; but My mercy extendeth to all things. That (mercy) I shall ordain for those who do right, and practise regular charity, and those who believe in Our signs;-

&quot;Those who follow the apostle, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own (scriptures),- in the law and the Gospel;- for he commands them what is just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honour him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down with him,- it is they who will prosper.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:158"> <sup>158</sup></span>
Say: &quot;O men! I am sent unto you all, as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there is no god but He: it is He That giveth both life and death.

We divided them into twelve tribes or nations. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for water: &quot;Strike the rock with thy staff&quot;: out of it there gushed forth twelve springs: Each group knew its own place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails, (saying): &quot;Eat of the good things We have provided for you&quot;: (but they rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.<sup><a href="wiki/Islamic_Prophecies-_Artesian_wells.html" title="Islamic Prophecies: Artesian wells"><font color="darkorange"><b>C</b></font></a></sup>

And remember it was said to them: &quot;Dwell in this town and eat therein as ye wish, but say the word of humility and enter the gate in a posture of humility: We shall forgive you your faults; We shall increase (the portion of) those who do good.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:162"> <sup>162</sup></span>
But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been given them so we sent on them a plague from heaven. For that they repeatedly transgressed.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:163"> <sup>163</sup></span>
Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding up their heads, but on the day they had no Sabbath, they came not: thus did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:164"> <sup>164</sup></span>
When some of them said: &quot;Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?&quot;- said the preachers:&quot; To discharge our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:165"> <sup>165</sup></span>
When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous punishment because they were given to transgression.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:166"> <sup>166</sup></span>
When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to them: &quot;Be ye apes, despised and rejected.&quot;

Behold! thy Lord did declare that He would send against them, to the Day of Judgment, those who would afflict them with grievous penalty. Thy Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

We broke them up into sections on this earth. There are among them some that are the righteous, and some that are the opposite. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity: In order that they might turn (to us).

After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world, saying (for excuse): &quot;(Everything) will be forgiven us.&quot; (Even so), if similar vanities came their way, they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will ye not understand?
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:170"> <sup>170</sup></span>
As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer,- never shall We suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.

When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them (We said): &quot;Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein; perchance ye may fear Allah.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:172"> <sup>172</sup></span>
When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves, (saying): &quot;Am I not your Lord (who cherishes and sustains you)?&quot;- They said: &quot;Yea! We do testify!&quot; (This), lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: &quot;Of this we were never mindful&quot;:
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="7:173"> <sup>173</sup></span>
Or lest ye should say: &quot;Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are (their) descendants after them: wilt Thou then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile?&quot;

If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but he inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue, or if you leave him alone, he (still) lolls out his tongue.
