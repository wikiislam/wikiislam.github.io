<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: A lady committed theft during the lifetime of Allah's Apostle in the Ghazwa of Al-Fath, ((i.e. Conquest of Mecca). Her folk went to Usama bin Zaid to intercede for her (with the Prophet). When Usama interceded for her with Allah's Apostle, the color of the face of Allah's Apostle changed and he said, &quot;Do you intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by Allah?&quot; Usama said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! Ask Allah's Forgiveness for me.&quot; So in the afternoon, Allah's Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He deserved and then said, &quot;Amma ba'du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would apply (Allah's) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad's soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand.&quot; Then Allah's Apostle gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off. Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. 'Aisha said, &quot;That lady used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Allah's Apostle.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.597#005.059.597">5:59:597</a></div></div>

I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away from him, He (again) came round facing him and said to him: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. He (the Holy Prophet) turned away until he did that four times, and as he testified four times against his own self, Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) called him and said: Are you mad? He said: No. He (again) said: Are you married? He said: Yes. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: <b>Take him and stone him</b>. Ibn Shihab (one of the narrators) said: One who had heard Jabir b. 'Abdullah saying this informed me thus: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the place of prayer (either that of 'Id or a funeral). When the stones hurt him, he ran away. We caught him in the Harra and stoned him (to death).

The second claimant who was wiser than him said: Well, decide amongst us according to the Book of Allah, but permit me (to say something). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon ham) said: Say. He said: My son was a servant in the house of this person and he committed adultery with his wife. I was informed that my son deserved stoning to death (as punishment for this offence). I gave one hundred goats and a slave girl as ransom for this. I asked the scholars (if this could serve as an expiation for this offence). They informed me that my son deserved one hundred lathes and exile for one year. and this woman deserved stoning (as she was married). Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace he upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life. I will decide between you according to the Book of Allah. The slave-girl and the goats should be given back, and <b>your son is to be punished with one hundred lashes and exile for one year. And, O Unais (b.

Sufyan says that all the narrators except 'Amr have stated that his wife said: I hear a voice which sounds like the voice of murder. He said: It is only Muhammad b. Maslama and his foster-brother, Abu Na'ila. When a gentleman is called at night even it to be pierced with a spear, he should respond to the call. Muhammad said to his companions: As he comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: We sense from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So he caught it and smelt.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fatwas">Fatwas</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a kind of kufr. If that is done by a Muslim then it is apostasy on his part, and <b>the authorities have to defend the cause of Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by executing the one who defamed him</b>. If the one who defamed him repents openly and is sincere, that will benefit him before Allaah, although his repentance does not waive the punishment for defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is execution. If the person who defames him is a non-Muslim living under a treaty with the Muslim state, then this is a violation of the treaty and he must be executed, but that should be left to the authorities. If a Muslim hears a Christian or anyone else defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) he has to denounce him in strong terms. It is permissible to insult that person because he is the one who started it. How can we not stand up the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? <b>It is also obligatory to report him to the authorities who can carry out the punishment on him. If there is no one who can carry out the hadd punishment of Allaah and stand up for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) then the Muslim has to do whatever he can</b>, so long as that will not lead to further mischief and harm against other people.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/14305/defamation%20of%20the%20prophet">&quot;It is essential to respond to those who defame the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.islamqa.com%2Fen%2Fref%2F14305%2Fdefamation%2520of%2520the%2520prophet&date=2013-06-19?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.islamqa.com%2Fen%2Fref%2F14305%2Fdefamation%2520of%2520the%2520prophet&date=2013-06-19">archived</a>)</span><br>Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak, Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 14305<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/14305/defamation%20of%20the%20prophet">http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/14305/defamation%20of%20the%20prophet</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=It+is+essential+to+respond+to+those+who+defame+the+Prophet+%28peace+and+blessings+of+Allaah+be+upon+him%29&rft.atitle=&rft.aulast=Shaykh+%E2%80%98Abd+al-Rahmaan+al-Barraak&rft.au=Shaykh+%E2%80%98Abd+al-Rahmaan+al-Barraak&rft.series=Fatwa+No.+14305&rft.pub=Islam+Q%26A&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.islamqa.com%2Fen%2Fref%2F14305%2Fdefamation%2520of%2520the%2520prophet&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Punishments"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
