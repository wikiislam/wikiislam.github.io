<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>
<p><b>Amputation</b>, is the removal of part or all of a body part enclosed by skin.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>  Within the context of <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>, it refers to the removal of the hands or feet. This, along with beheading, flogging, <a href="wiki/Stoning.html" title="Stoning">stoning</a>, and <a href="wiki/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a>, is a prescribed punishment in <a href="wiki/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law" class="mw-redirect">Islamic law</a>.

<p>Today in Saudi Arabia, for example, amputation for criminal punishment is not performed by a medical professional but rather by the designated professional executioner who also earns his living beheading people.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>  Muhammad Saad Al-Beshi, Saudi Arabia's leading executioner, describes amputation:
</p>
<div class="quotes">I use a special sharp knife, not a sword.  When I cut off a hand I cut it from the joint. If it is a leg the authorities specify where it is to be taken off, so I follow that.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>Amputation is used as punishment for theft in Nigeria, which reintroduced shariah law in 1999.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> This, along with other shari'ah punishments, are &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; supported by the Nigerian Muslim population,<sup id="cite_ref-Nigerian_Muslims_Support_Sharia_5-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-Nigerian_Muslims_Support_Sharia-5">[5]</a></sup> and by 2003 three men already had their arms amputated for stealing; a goat, a cow, and two bicycles.<sup id="cite_ref-Nigerian_Muslims_Support_Sharia_5-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-Nigerian_Muslims_Support_Sharia-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p><p>In Somalia, one man found guilty of stealing was put on public display as his hand was severed at the wrist and then dangled by the index finger.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> In June of the same year (2009), a court run by an Islamic group sentenced four Somali men to each have a hand and a leg cut off for allegedly stealing mobile phones and guns.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>  
</p><p>In 2008, the Islamic Republic of Iran saw five double amputations in a single week--five convicted robbers were each sentenced to have their right hands and left feet amputated.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>When the Taliban, an Islamic militant group, took over Afghanistan in 1996, within a year, public executions, amputations and stonings were a regular Friday event in Kabul.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>  In 1998, the AFP reported this event:
</p>
<div class="quotes">The hardline Taliban Friday publicly executed a murderer and amputated limbs of two robbers amid shouts of &quot;God is the Greatest&quot; at the Kabul stadium, witnesses said. Thousands of Taliban soldiers and citizens, including women, watched the proceedings. The murderer squatted and after his face was covered with a pink mask he was shot dead by the father of the man allegedly killed by the accused earlier this year. Later a team of surgeons wearing blue masks chopped off right hands and left feet of two men convicted of highway robbery. The surgeons amputated the limbs after anaesthetizing the convicts and left the severed limbs on the ground for the spectators to rush and have a close look. The three were convicted by a military tribunal created by the Taliban supreme leader Mulla Omar to deal with criminal cases under the Islamic Sharia law. Taliban, who now control almost three-quarter of Afghanistan, have enforced punishments in public under the Islamic law which they say helped deter and curb criminal acts.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Amputation_in_Islam.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p>While the majority of Muslim translators have remained true to the Arabic text, many apologists have attempted to obscure the plain meaning of <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.038#005.038">5:38</a>. However, the <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a> prove its meaning is entirely literal. Furthermore, Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and the early generations of Muslims had no qualms with it being so.

<div class="quotes">Yahya related to me from Malik from Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Hazim that Amra bint Abd ar-Rahman said, &quot;A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went out to Makka and she had two girl mawlas of hers and a slave belonging to the sons of Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr as-Siddiq . She sent a figured cloak with the two mawlas which was sewn up in a piece of green cloth.&quot; 
<p>Amra continued, &quot;The slave took it and unstitched it and took out the cloak. In its place, he put some felt or skin and sewed it up again. When the mawla girls came to Madina, they gave it to his people. When they opened it, they found felt in it and did not find the cloak. They spoke to the two women and they spoke to A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, or they wrote to her and suspected the slave. The slave was asked about it and confessed. A'isha, the wife of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the order and his hand was cut off. A'isha said, 'A thief's hand is cut off for a quarter of a dinar and upwards.'&quot; 
</p>
Malik said, &quot;The limit I prefer above which cutting off the hand is obliged is three dirhams, whether the exchange is high or low. That is because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, cut off the hand of a thief for a shield whose value was three dirhams, and Uthman ibn Affan cut off the hand of a thief for a citron which was estimated at three dirhams.

<div class="quotes">(But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds, then verily, Allah will pardon him. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Therefore, whoever repents and goes back to Allah after he commits theft, then Allah will forgive him. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that a woman committed theft during the time of the Messenger of Allah and those from whom she stole brought her and said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! This woman stole from us.<i> Her people said, &quot;We ransom her.&quot; The Messenger of Allah said,</i>
<p>(Cut off her hand.) They said, &quot;We ransom her with five hundred Dinars.&quot; The Prophet said,
</p><p>(Cut off her hand.) Her right hand was cut off and the woman asked, &quot;O Messenger of Allah! Is there a chance for me to repent&quot; He said,
</p><p>(Yes. This day, you are free from your sin just as the day your mother gave birth to you.) Allah sent down the verse in Surat Al-Ma'idah,
</p><p>(But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then verily, Allah will pardon him. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This woman was from the tribe of Makhzum. Her story was narrated in the Two Sahihs from Az-Zuhri from `Urwah from `A'ishah, The incident caused concern for the Quraysh after she committed the theft during the time of the battle of the Conquest [of Makkah]. They said, &quot;Who can talk to Allah's Messenger about her matter&quot; They then said, &quot;Who dares speak to him about such matters other than Usamah bin Zayd, his loved one.&quot; When the woman was brought to the Messenger of Allah , Usamah bin Zayd talked to him about her and the face of the Messenger changed color (because of anger) and he said,
</p><p>(Do you intercede in a punishment prescribed by Allah) Usamah said to him, &quot;Ask Allah to forgive me, O Allah's Messenger!&quot; During that night, the Messenger of Allah stood up and gave a speech and praised Allah as He deserves to be praised. He then said,

(Those who were before you were destroyed because when an honorable person among them would steal, they would leave him. But, when a weak man among them stole, they implemented the prescribed punishment against him. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! If Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad stole, I will have her hand cut off.) The Prophet commanded that the hand of the woman who stole be cut off, and it was cut off.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=5&tid=13843?sid=5&tid=13843">Repentance of the Thief is Acceptable</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Where_should_amputated_limbs_be_buried.3F">Where should amputated limbs be buried?</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allaah. 
<p>This matter is open, because amputated limbs do not come under the same ruling as the whole person. There is no reason why they should not be put with the garbage, but burying them in the ground out of respect towards them is preferable. But the matter is open, praise be to Allaah, as we said. They do not have to be washed (ghusl) and buried unless it is a foetus of more than four months’ gestation. But if it was merely flesh into which the soul had not yet been breathed, or it was an amputated finger or something similar, then the matter is open. But burying it in the ground is good and is preferable.

<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allaah.   
<p>The thief has no right to have the amputated hand reattached, because that means that the signs of the punishment for his crime disappear, and the effectiveness of the rebuke and lesson is lost. It is contrary to the idea of punishment and example as mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah. And Allaah is All‑Powerful, All‑Wise”
