<div class="quotes">A lecture by the Dutch writer Benno Barnard has been disrupted by radical Muslims.  Several dozen young Muslims were at the beginning of the nomination right slogans and began to cry.
<p>The Dutch Islam critic, writer and notoriously Benno Barnard last night gave a lecture titled The Islam debate: long live God, away with Allah.  That was part of a series of lectures on the Enlightenment, organized by the Lay Department of the University of Antwerp.  Some radical Muslim organizations had to advance through websites summoned to the auditorium at the Rodestraat to drop and disrupt the lecture. 
</p><p>When the presentation began at 20 hours, had a forty Muslims among the audience mixed.  The organizer of the lecture they are trying to change its mind, but once Barnard began his speech, were the right people and started to cry.  &quot;I had just a few words, or the leader stood up and shouted with God is not mocked,&quot; says Barnard.  &quot;After that, he and his followers&quot; Allah akbar &quot;to call them and stormed the stage.  If I had no bodyguards, then I can not now be able to assist. &quot; 
</p><p>Some policemen were in civilian presence in the room and performed quickly.  Some twenty troublemakers were escorted out but no one was arrested. 
</p><p>Alain Verschoren rector of the University of Antwerp regrets the incident.  &quot;It bothers me greatly that the reading they have broken off after two minutes.  These young people have not even heard what the argument was about.  That can only mean that either they were afraid of the content, or content that they did not want to hear. &quot; 
</p><p>The website of the radical organization Sharia4Belgium was mainly the title of the lecture on the grain taken: &quot;The title is yet another slap in the face of the Muslim community,&quot; it states.  Rector Verschoren perspective: &quot;The lecture was indeed a provocative title, but I think that extreme opinions should be.  As long as there is possibility to respond to one thing and discussion may pluralistic institution like the UA. &quot; 
</p>
Barnard himself was unhappy about the incident: &quot;Is not it disturbing that in 2010 an intellectual who wants to give a lecture, police protection needs?  Actually, this is my best lecture ever.  This incident proves what I've been trying to say: that Islam is a completely intolerant system. &quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=CG2OB6L5&date=2011-12-16?url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=CG2OB6L5&date=2011-12-16">Radical Muslims disrupt reading Benno Barnard</a><br>Nieuwsblad, April 1, 2010</div></div>

<div class="quotes">‘Jews are deserting Antwerp’, headlines De Standaard. The Belgian newspaper predicts that in fifty years there will be no more Jews living in the city. Due to an increase of Anti-Semitism, many young Jews are leaving the city to study in London, New York or Israel, where &quot;working with a skullcap (kippah) isn’t a problem&quot;, and they never return. Furthermore, it has become more difficult for them to start a career in Antwerp since the Jewish community has lost its dominant position in the diamond trade and hasn’t found a new economic alternative yet.

<div class="quotes">A police officer has been attacked by a Muslim man in Brussels after he demanded that the man’s wife remove her veil. Belgium outlawed the wearing of Islamic garments which cover the face. 
<p>The incident occurred after the couple was spotted by a police squad patrolling the Saint-Josse community – a neighborhood where many immigrants live, reports Belga news agency.
</p><p>One of the officers demanded the woman’s ID and wanted to see her face for proper identification. The husband became angry and threatened the officers with death should they ever come close to his wife again.
</p><p>The ensuing quarrel quickly became a fistfight, which ended with one of the policemen receiving mild injuries.
</p><p>The 37-year-old assailant was detained and charged with attacking an officer of the law. His wife will be issued a fine for wearing the forbidden garment.
</p><p>Belgium banned wearing of clothes that hide face, such as the burqa or the niqab, in June. Violations carry a 137.5 euro fine and up to seven days in jail.
</p>
France was the first European country to ban the face-concealing Muslim garments in April.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">*<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://rt.com/news/muslim-attack-policeman-burqa-685/&date=2011-10-01?url=http://rt.com/news/muslim-attack-policeman-burqa-685/&date=2011-10-01">Belgian cop attacked for trying to unveil Muslim woman</a><br>RT, September 29, 2011</div></div>

The Jewish group added it is considering filing a civil suit and said the Jewish community is “exasperated” by repeated attacks on Jews, which has a Jewish population of 40,000.
</p><p>It also told the Belgian French community's Education Minister he should &quot;introduce appropriate educational programs in schools to prevent unjustified tensions between communities,” the European Jewish Press reported.

<p>The two victims, a man and a woman who were attacked during a routine check, did not sustain life-threatening wounds, the reports said.
</p><p>The attacker was quickly subdued and was found to be carrying documents connected to Shariah4Belgium, an extremist Muslim group active in Belgium, public television said.
</p><p>“He confessed to wanting to attack the police because of Belgium's attitude towards Muslims,” television said.
</p><p>Clashes broke out last week in the same Molenbeek neighborhood between police and Muslim youth over the arrest of a young woman wearing a full veil.

The Shariah4Belgium group had then posted a video on the Internet defending the detained woman.

<div class="quotes">There was trouble in the Brussels municipality of Sint-Jans-Molenbeek on Thursday after a woman wearing a niqab was detained by police. A niqab is a headscarf worn by some Muslim women. The niqab covers all of the face except the eyes and is part of the sartorial hijab. The wearing of the niqab (and the burqa) in public is forbidden in Belgium. 
<p>The niqab-wearer was asked to produce proof of identity by police in the neighbouring municipality of Jette on Thursday afternoon.
</p><p>She refused to remove her niqab and was taken to a Molenbeek police station for questioning. At the police station the woman injured a female police officer by head-butting her.
</p><p>The policewoman had been trying to frisk the woman. She sustained a broken nose and lost two-teeth in the attack. Another policewoman also sustained slight injuries in the attack.
</p><p>The woman, a Belgian convert to Islam, is well-known to police. She has often been the subject of identity checks and always refuses to remove her niqab.
</p><p>She was also injured in the fracas and was taken to hospital with slight concussion.
</p><p>News of the incident spread quickly and soon the police station was surrounded by around 100 youths.
</p><p>The Brussels West Police Services called in re-enforcements from the Federal Police and other Brussels police forces to contain the situation.
</p><p>Nevertheless, several windows were smashed and bus-shelters damaged by the youths.
</p><p>Six people were detained. The Mayor of Molenbeek Philippe Moureaux (Francophone socialist, photo) went to the scene to try and help diffuse the situation.
</p>
By 9:30 pm calm had returned to the vicinity of the police station.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/news/120601_Molem">Veiled woman breaks police officer's nose</a><br>FlandersNews.be, June 1, 2012</div></div>
