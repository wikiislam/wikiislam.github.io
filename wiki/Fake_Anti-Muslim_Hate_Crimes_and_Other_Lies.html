<td> A Muslim woman accused a Sydney Police Officer of &quot;racism&quot; and claimed he physically attempted to remove her veil during a routine traffic stop. In an emotional Channel 7 interview, she tearfully described the &quot;fear&quot; she felt when faced with this &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; officer who shouted at her. The police officer in question was later cleared of the charge when patrol car video footage proved he never once touched her and was polite throughout the exchange. When asked by Channel 7 to return and explain what the footage showed, she declined the offer. Even after these accusations have been proven false, it is stirring up anger within the Islamic community with text messages describing the police officer as “an enemy of allah” being sent in mass.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Amazingly she escaped jail-time for her false accusations by again lying and claiming it was not her in the veil<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>A pizzeria owned by Albanian Muslims in Wörgl, Austria, was badly burned. A nearby building owned by a Turkish association was also set on fire. 'Racist' graffiti in Turkish was left on the scene, complete with swastika symbols. This immediately provoked demonstrations from Turks and Greens protesting against &quot;right-wingers&quot; and &quot;racists&quot;. One placard read: &quot;Racism isn't an opinion! Racism is a crime.&quot; It was later learned that both fires were set by the Muslims themselves, after two of the perpertrators were injured in their own attack when the fire they were setting produced an explosion.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<td>Following Jyllands-Posten's publication of the infamous Muhammad Cartoons, the Danish Muslim leader Ahmad Abu Laban took it upon himself to spearhead a campaign demanding an apology from Jyllands-Posten. A delegation of Danish Muslim leaders, headed by Laban and Lebanese-born theological student Ahmed Akkari, traveled to the Middle East to publicize and garner opposition to the offending cartoons. However, the number of images taken to the Middle East had risen from twelve to fifteen. These additional images were a lot more offensive than any of the original twelve. According to the BBC, the source of these images (through their own admission) had been traced back to the delegation of Danish Muslim leaders themselves

<td>In what appears to be an attempt to further vilify websites critical of Islam, various representatives of the Muslim community reported to the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) that there had been &quot;racist murders, mainly committed by racist groups which publish hate messages on their websites&quot;. However, the Finnish authorities expressed surprise and informed the Human Rights Commission that they were &quot;not aware of any murders committed with racist motives,&quot; and that &quot;they had never worked on any criminal investigations concerning the death of any Muslims.&quot; Päivi Mattila, Secretary General of the Finnish League for Human Rights agreed, stating that she had complete faith in the view of the Finnish authorities. She noted that she had not heard of any claims of 'racially-motivated' killings against Muslims or any other racial minority. &quot;Rather there has been word of other types of hate crimes, which have been met with convictions.”

<td>A representative of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Badawi caused a controversy when she posted a picture via Twitter of a bloodied Palestinian girl held in her’s father arms. The caption attached to the image read: “Palestine is bleeding. Another child killed by Israel. Another father carrying a child into a grave in Gaza.” In addition to violating the rule of impartiality, the Twitter message, which was a huge hit, was proven to be a lie. The girl in the picture was actually injured by falling off a swing in 2006. Tragically, this lie may have also been the motivation behind the March 2012 Toulouse massacre of Jews in France. The media reported that Mohammed Merah was motivated by Israel's killing of children in Gaza earlier in the month. However, Israel did not kill any children in Gaza that month, but with lies like Badawi's being widely spread between Muslims, he would have thought otherwise

Many posted the photograph again, explaining that the caption claiming the soldier was Israeli had to be false because his uniform was not that of the IDF's, nor does the Israeli army regularly use AK-47s. &quot;Don't believe everything you see on the Internet,&quot; wrote blogger Omar Dakhane, who uploaded a wider framed version of the image, showing a crowd surrounding the soldier and the girl. &quot;This picture was taken in Bahrain 2009 during a street theater.&quot;...

The SD politician insisted he was innocent, but a police investigation began and he and his family were faced with criticism from the media and internet communities. CCTV footage of the incident showed that, not realizing she was on camera, it was in fact the Muslim women who attacked the politician. After tearing his clothes, she fell to the floor dramatically and started wailing. Wikström was eventually cleared of all suspicion. Whether or not the woman will be prosecuted remains unclear.

A &quot;cycle of violence&quot; against Muslims. &quot;The scale of the backlash is astounding ... there has been a massive spike in anti-Muslim prejudice.

This prompted a media blitz by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and calls for investigations by state and federal civil rights agencies. Detroit and local news organizations covered the story of a potential hate crime, the director of the state Department of Civil Rights issued a statement calling on the school district to implement conflict resolution and “cultural competency” programs, and CAIR went to the Islamic center in Ann Arbor to talk with congregants who were concerned. However, investigators found evidence that contradicted much of what the 16-year-old had said. She was not “jumped” or assaulted by a “mob”. In reality, no one touched her except one other 16-year-old African-American girl. There were no ethnic slurs or hijabs removed. It was simply a fight between 2 kids. The Arab-American girl was eventually charged and found guilty of disorderly conduct. Like other fabricated hate crimes, CAIR has not updated the information on their website or acknowledged it in any public statement

It was the fourth arson attack on the restaurant within the space of six-weeks, the third resulting from a Molotov cocktail being thrown through the front window. Only hours before the forth attack, the owner vowed he would &quot;never give into pressure to close the store&quot;. However, investigators discovered that the explosion was actually set by the owner and his son. &quot;The Shteiwis were standing in a pool of gasoline that they intended to use as an accelerant in setting their store ablaze later that night when Musa Shteiwi took a break and lit up a cigarette, igniting the gasoline prematurely and causing the blast&quot;.

<td>The Imam of the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Virginia (formerly the Secretary General of the Muslim American Society) claimed in a 2005 interview on National Public Radio, “I believe there is no apology for terrorism. We condemned it; we condemned it on 9/11, I personally signed a paper on behalf of the organization I worked for at that time and sent it everywhere to the press. I spoke with the press.” However, in February 2013, he was caught on camera advocating armed jihad before an Ethiopian Muslim group gathered at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va. “[Muslims] are last if anything is being distributed, unless it is arms for jihad... We are the first to rush and run to defend our community and defend ourselves. The enemies of Allah are lining up; the question for us is, ‘Are we lining, or are we afraid because, because they may call us terrorists.’” Being called “terrorists” should not matter to Muslims because non-Muslims are being called terrorists anyway, Elsayed said. “You are a terrorist because you are a Muslim. Well give them a run for their money. Make it worth it. Make this title worth it, and be good a Muslim.”

<p>According to FBI <a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html" title="Muslim Statistics - Crime and Prejudice">hate-crime statistics</a>, hate crimes directed against Muslims &quot;remain relatively rare&quot; in the United states,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> with gays, lesbians and caucasians more frequently a target than the followers of Islam. 
</p><p>Jewish victims of hate crimes also outnumber Muslim victims by a ratio of almost 9 to 1, and anti-Muslim incidents only account for a tiny 1.3% of all hate crimes. Even anti-Christian (Catholic/Protestant) incidents outnumber those perpetrated against Muslims in America. Some of the cases above also put into doubt the truth behind all 105 reported incidents. 
</p><p>Regardless of these facts, many have begun to refer to Muslims as the &quot;new Jews&quot;. Such statements can be offensive when you consider that the dwindling number of &quot;old Jews&quot; are still the most persecuted religious minority in the Western world. In fact anti-Semitic incidents around the world have more than doubled in 2009 over the previous year<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and in Oslo Jews are more than 6 times more likely than Muslims to experience harassment.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> The growing anti-Semitism around the world, particularly in the West, is coming from the growing number of <a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Antisemitism.html" title="Muslim Statistics - Antisemitism">Muslims</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Additionally, a July 2011 Pew Global Attitudes survey found that a &quot;greater percentage of Western publics now see relations between themselves and Muslims as generally good&quot; whilst, &quot;as in the past, Muslims express more unfavorable opinions about Christians than Americans or Europeans express about Muslims.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Such findings lead many to ask, who are the ones suffering from a &quot;phobia&quot;? 
</p><p>This is a very important question. On an international scale, it is the Christians who are the world's most persecuted religious group, and this persecution is mainly from Muslims.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Fake_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crimes_and_Other_Lies.html#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Likewise, there are 7 countries in the world where the state can execute you for being atheist.
