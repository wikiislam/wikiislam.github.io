<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an is claimed to be a revelation from <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> to Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> through the Angel <a href="wiki/Gabriel.html" title="Gabriel">Gabriel</a>. It was revealed to Muhammad in stages, taking 23 years to reach its completion. 
</p><p>At no time during Muhammad's life did he ever order these alleged revelations to be compiled into a single book.<sup id="cite_ref-Abu_Bakr_1-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-Abu_Bakr-1">[1]</a></sup> If Muhammad was, as he claimed, a messenger to all mankind, it is perplexing as to why he never gave thought to the preservation of his message. 
</p><p>His followers must solely take the credit of the Qur'an's existence today and its spreading to people beyond those which Muhammad had initially subjugated. Muslims however would argue that the Qur'an was preserved by Allah as he had promised.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Evidence_from_Within">The Evidence from Within</span></h2>
<p>We can find evidence that suggests the Qur'an was corrupted through many sources, but what is most striking is the evidence from the Qur'an itself. The Qur'an tells us &quot;There were some among the Jews who <i>pervert</i> words from their proper places...&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The word &quot;pervert&quot; in <a href="wiki/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> is <i>Yuharifoon</i>, which means &quot;corrupt&quot;. Therefore, according to the Qur'an, <i>al-Tahreef</i> (corruption) is achieved through changing words from their proper places. 
</p><p>Has the Qur'an been subjected to such changes? Beyond a shadow of doubt, it has. If we read <a href="wiki/Surah.html" title="Surah">surah</a> 5:3, it says &quot;This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as religion.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>This was quoted from chapter 5, and the Qur'an contains 114 chapters in total. How can the religion of Islam be completed by chapter 5, when there are 109 chapters yet to come? If it was completed in chapter 5, then there is no need for the 109 chapters ahead. 
</p><p>Some Muslims argue that this verse was the last verse revealed. If that is so, was the revelation imperfect until this verse was revealed? Also, why then is it not placed at the conclusion? This proves that Muslims have changed the words from their right places, and according to the Qur'an, that is <i>Tahreef</i> (Corruption). 
</p><p>The first surah to be revealed was al-Alak, yet it is surah <a href="wiki/Al-Fatiha.html" title="Al-Fatiha">al-Fatiha</a> which we find at the beginning of the Qur'an. Instead, Muslims have placed the first chapter to be revealed (al-Alaq), as chapter 96, towards the end of the Qur'an. 
</p><p>How is this <i>not</i> the changing of words from their right places? This is indeed 'Tahreef'. Muslims have not arranged the <a href="wiki/Chronological_Order_of_the_Qur'an.html" title="Chronological Order of the Qur'an">surahs chronologically</a>. They took it upon themselves to organize the <a href="wiki/Revelations.html" title="Revelations">revelations</a> instead of Allah completing this task himself.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Could_the_Qur.27an_have_Been_Preserved_through_Memorization.3F">Could the Qur'an have Been Preserved through Memorization?</span></h2>
<p>We would say no, as Muhammad himself had forgotten portions of the Qur'an and needed his followers to remind him.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> This led to him having a <a href="wiki/Muhammad's_Just_In_Time_Revelations.html" title="Muhammad's Just In Time Revelations">&quot;just in time&quot; revelation</a><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> claiming that some verses were to be forgotten. 
</p><p>What about the great memorizers of Islam from among the <a href="wiki/Salaf.html" title="Salaf">Salaf</a>, maybe they had successfully memorized it? Well, that would not work as an argument. The best, and most, of the Qurra' (“reciters”) had died before its compilation.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Abu Bakr even knew that the Qur'an would be hard to collect<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> and that Muhammad had never ordered such an action to be taken.<sup id="cite_ref-Abu_Bakr_1-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-Abu_Bakr-1">[1]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The Qur'an in fact was <i>not</i> memorized in full by the <a href="wiki/Sahabah.html" title="Sahabah">companions</a>, and for proof of this we need only look to the words of Zaid bin Thabit, the companion who was charged with its collection. 
</p><p>He had stated &quot;I started looking for the Qur'an and collecting it from (what was written on) palm-leaf stalks, thin white stones, and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last verse of Surat at-Tauba (repentance) with Abi Khuzaima al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Zaid_bin_Thabit_9-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-Zaid_bin_Thabit-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>Had the companions fully memorized it, why then would they look for verses in leafs and stones? Surah al-Taubah was found with one person only.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Disagreements_on_the_Qur.27an_and_its_Burning">Disagreements on the Qur'an and its Burning</span></h2>
<p>During the <a href="wiki/Caliph.html" title="Caliph">Caliphate</a> of Uthman, he heard that many Muslims were arguing that they can recite the Qur'an better, and they had differences between them.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Upon hearing this, Uthman hurriedly ordered the burning of both fragmentary manuscripts and whole copies of the Qur'an<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> and sent a message to Hafsa (one of <a href="wiki/Muhammad's_Wives.html" title="Muhammad's Wives">Muhammad's wives</a>) requesting the manuscripts she had in her possession.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Making a codex from what Zayd bin thabit had originally compiled,<sup id="cite_ref-Zaid_bin_Thabit_9-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-Zaid_bin_Thabit-9">[9]</a></sup> he gave it to the people. 
</p><p>Even after the final recension of the Qur'an during Uthman's reign, disputes still came to the fore in respect to the authenticity of the text. A very good example concerns a variant reading of Surah 2.238. 
</p><p>The Qur'an as it stands today, reads &quot;Maintain your prayers, particularly the middle prayer (as-salaatil wustaa), and stand before Allah in devoutness&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The variant reading of this verse was given by <a href="wiki/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a>, according to whom, in this verse it says 'Asr Prayer' (salaatiil 'asri).<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> However, according to Hafsa's Codex,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> this was never the case.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abdullah_bin_Mas.27ud-_Authority_of_the_Qur.27an_and_Best_Qur.27anic_Teacher">Abdullah bin Mas'ud- Authority of the Qur'an and Best Qur'anic Teacher</span></h2>
<p>Muhammad ordered Muslims to learn the Qur'an from four individuals and the first of them was Abdullah bin Mas'ud.<sup id="cite_ref-bin_Masud_16-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-bin_Masud-16">[16]</a></sup> So, according to Muhammad, Ibn Mas'ud was an authority on the Qur'an. 
</p><p>Ibn Mas'ud swore that he knew all the surahs of the Qur'an, saying &quot;By Allah other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped! There is no Sura revealed in Allah's Book but I know at what place it was revealed; and there is no verse revealed in Allah's Book but I know about whom it was revealed. And if I know that there is somebody who knows Allah's Book better than I, and he is at a place that camels can reach, I would go to him&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p>That is quite a grandiose statement by Ibn Mas'ud, which we cannot disagree with. After all, according to Muhammad's words, he was one of the chosen teachers whom Muslims were to go to when they desired to learn the Qur'an. 
</p><p>After Muhammad's choice of Abdullah bin Mas'ud, he was followed by Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhaifa, Mu'adh bin Jabal and Ubai bin Ka'b.<sup id="cite_ref-bin_Masud_16-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-bin_Masud-16">[16]</a></sup> What is odd is that we do not find any mention of Zayd Bin Thabit who was ultimately entrusted by Uthman with the task of collecting the Qur'an from scraps. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ibn_Mas.27ud.27s_Disagreement_with_Uthman">Ibn Mas'ud's Disagreement with Uthman</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an that Ibn Mas'ud had was known and agreed upon by many Muslims. When Uthman ordered that all codices must be destroyed and that only Zayd's codex is to be preserved, The reaction of Abdallah ibn Masud was great. 
</p><p>&quot;I have not led them [the people of Kufa] astray. There is no verse in the Book of Allah that I do not know where it was revealed and why it was revealed, and if I knew anyone more learned in the Book of Allah and I could be conveyed there, I would set out to him&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Referring to the authority given to Zaid bin thabit, Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said, &quot;I recited from the messenger of Allah (saw) seventy surahs which I had perfected before Zaid ibn Thabit had embraced Islam&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> 
</p><p>When Uthman ordered the destruction of Ibn Mas'ud's codex, Ibn Mas'ud gave a sermon in Kufa and said &quot;The people have been guilty of deceit in the reading of the Qur'an. I like it better to read according to the recitation of him (Prophet) whom I love more than that of Zayd Ibn Thabit. By Him besides Whom there is no god! I learnt more than seventy surahs from the lips of the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, while Zayd Ibn Thabit was a youth, having two locks and playing with the youth&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Zaid bin thabit was in no place to be a rival to the great scholar and teacher Ibn Mas'ud, and such sermons by him are devastating to the history of Islam and to the authenticity of the Qur'an. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_did_Ibn_Mas.27ud_have_in_his_Qur.27an_that_Uthman_did_not.3F">What did Ibn Mas'ud have in his Qur'an that Uthman did not?</span></h2>
<p>Ibn Mas'ud's Qur'anic text omitted surah al-Fatiha and the mu'awwithatayni (surahs 113 and 114).<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>  
</p><p>When we come to the rest of the Qur'an, we find that there were numerous differences of reading between the texts of Zaid and Ibn Mas'ud. The records in Ibn Abu Dawud's Kitab al-Masahif fill up no less than nineteen pages<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> and, from all the sources available, one can trace no less than 101 variants in the Suratul-Baqarah alone. 
</p><p>We will provide you with the mention of just a few of the differences here in illustration of the nature of the variations between the texts: 
</p><p>Surah 2:275 begins with the words <i>Allathiina yaakuluunar-ribaa laa yaquumuuna</i>, meaning &quot;those who devour usury will not stand&quot;. Ibn Mas'ud's text had the same introduction but after the last word there was added the expression <i>yawmal qiyaamati</i>, that is, they would not be able to stand on the &quot;Day of Resurrection&quot;. 
</p><p>The variant is mentioned in Abu Ubaid's Kitab Fadhail al-Qur'an.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> The variant was also recorded in the codex of Talha ibn Musarrif, a secondary codex dependent on Ibn Mas'ud's text, Taiha likewise being based at Kufa in Iraq where Ibn Mas'ud was based as governor and where his codex was widely followed.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Surah 5:91, in the standard text, contains the exhortation <i>fasiyaamu thalaathati ayyaamin</i>, meaning &quot;fast for three days&quot;. Ibn Mas'ud's text had, after the last word, the adjective <i>mutataabi'aatin</i>, meaning three &quot;successive&quot; days. 
</p><p>The variant derives from at-Tabari<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> and was also mentioned by Abu Ubaid. This variant reading was, significantly, found in Ubayy ibn Ka'b's text as well<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> and in the texts of Ibn Abbas<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> and Ibn Mas'ud's pupil Ar-Rabi ibn Khuthaim.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The Qur'an we have today was rejected by Ibn Masud, whom the prophet of Islam himself approved of. This tells us that the Qur'an we have is not the word of Allah. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ubay_bin_Ka.27b">Ubay bin Ka'b</span></h2>
<p>Ubay ibn Ka'b, one of the four which were singled-out by Muhammad,<sup id="cite_ref-bin_Masud_16-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-bin_Masud-16">[16]</a></sup> was considered the best reciter of the Qur'an.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> He was known as Sayidul Qura' (The Master of Reciters). Umar the Caliph also agreed that Ubay was the best reciter.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Ubay agreed with Ibn Mas'ud and disagreed with Zayd on the following: 
</p><p>1. For the standard reading <i>wa yush-hidullaaha</i> in Surah 2:204 he read <i>wa yastash-hidullaaha</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> <br>2. He omitted the words <i>in khiftum</i> from Surah 4:101.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup><br>3. He read <i>mutathab-thibiina</i> for <i>muthabthabiina</i> in Surah 4:143.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> 
</p><p>There are a number of cases where whole clauses differed in his text. In Surah 5:48, where the standard text reads <i>wa katabnaa 'alayhim fiiha</i>, meaning &quot;and We inscribed therein for them (the Jews)&quot;, the reading of Ubayy ibn Ka'b was <i>wa anzalallaahu alaa banii Isra'iila fiiha</i>, meaning &quot;and Allah sent down therein to the Children of Israel.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>
</p><p>From Abu Ubaid we find that, whereas Surah 17:16 in the standard text reads <i>amarnaa mutrafiihaa fafasaquu</i>, Ubay read this clause <i>ba'athnaa akaabira mujri-miihaa fdmakaruu</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>
</p><p>We know that, whereas Ibn Mas'ud omitted two surahs (113 and 114) from his codex, Ubayy included two extra surahs, al-Hafd (the Haste)<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> and al-Khal' (the Separation).<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

</p><p>Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, one of the early authorities on the Qur'an text and a companion of Muhammad, claimed a surah which resembled at-Tawba in length and severity was forgotten and lost.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Alhajjaj_changes_the_Uthmanic_Qur.27an">Alhajjaj changes the Uthmanic Qur'an</span></h2>
<p>The text we have today is not even Uthman's Revised Version of the Qur'an, but it incorporates changes by Al-Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf Al-Thakafi. 
</p><p>Al-Hajjaj Ibn Yusuf Al-Thakafi, who lived in the years AD 660-714, was a teacher of the Arabic language in the city of Taif. Then he joined the military and became the most powerful person during the reign of Caliph Abd al-Malik Ibn Marawan and after him his son al-Waleed Ibn Abd al-Malik. Because Al-Hajjaj taught Arabic, he gave himself the liberty to change several words of Caliph Uthman's Qur'an, which is an indication that he did not believe that the Qur'an was verbally inspired or was inscribed in a &quot;tablet preserved.&quot; 
</p><p>For brevity's sake we will only mention a few of these changes: 
</p><p>1. In Surah Yunus 10:22, he changed the word <i>yanshorokom</i>, which means &quot;spread you,&quot; to <i>yousayerokom</i>, which means &quot;makes you to go on.&quot; 
</p><p>2. In Surah Ash-Shuara 26:116, he changed the word <i>Al-Mukhrageen</i>, which means &quot;the cast out,&quot; to <i>Al-Margoomeen</i>, which means &quot;those who are to be stoned [to death].&quot; 
</p><p>3. In Surah Ash-Shuara 26:167, he changed the word <i>Min Al-Margoomeen</i>, which means &quot;those who are to be stoned to death,&quot; to <i>Al-Mukhrageen</i>, which means &quot;those who will assuredly be cast out.&quot;
</p><p>4. In Surah Muhammad 47:15, he changed the word <i>yasen</i>, which is poor Arabic to <i>Asen</i>, which means &quot;unpolluted.&quot; 
</p><p>5. In Surah al-Hadid 57:7, he changed the word <i>wataqu</i>, which means &quot;feared Allah,&quot; to <i>Wa-anfaqu</i>, which means &quot;spend in charity.&quot; 
</p><p>If you read Qur'anic <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">Tafsirs</a> such as al-Jalalayn and others on these verses, you will notice that they will say that there are other readings of these words, proving that there was corruption.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_in_the_Hafs_and_Warsh_Texts">Differences in the Hafs and Warsh Texts</span></h2>
<p>Apart from other earlier variant text, there are two different texts of the Qur'an currently in print, named after their respective 2nd-century transmitters Hafs (from Kufa) and Warsh (from Medina). 
</p><p>The Hafs text is the more common and used in most areas of the Islamic world. Warsh is used mainly in West and North-West Africa as well as by the Zaydiya in Yemen. Here are some of the differences:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diacritical_Marks_and_Grammatical_Mistakes">Diacritical Marks and Grammatical Mistakes</span></h2>
<p>The Qur'an was written without <a href="wiki/Diacritical_Marks_of_the_Qur'an.html" title="Diacritical Marks of the Qur'an">diacritical marks</a>. At the time of Muhammad, Arabic orthography was yet to develop into what we have known for centuries. 
</p><p>For the early interpretors who added diacritical marks, to read the Qur'an as it was originally written, would lead the reader to interpret and choose for themselves from the many possible meanings available. 
</p><p>Muslims began using diacritical marks because reading &quot;errors&quot; began to appear,<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> and the differences this created had led to differences in Islamic law.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_the_Quran.html#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>
</p><p>The following are just a few examples from among many grammatical <i>mistakes</i> which show that the Qur'an is not flawless.
</p><p>1. <i>Sabi'een</i> or <i>Sabi'oon</i>, one must be wrong (5:69, 22:17) 
</p><p>2. <i>Butunihi</i> is a mistake in 16:66. It must be <i>Butuniha</i>, because it is referring to the plural (cattle). 
</p><p>3. <i>Kon fayakoon</i>, meaning &quot;be and it is&quot;, must be <i>kon fakana</i>, meaning &quot;be and he was&quot; in 3:59, because it refers to the past not present.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Corruption_of_Previous_Scriptures">Corruption of Previous Scriptures</span></h2>
<p>Many Muslims erroneously believe that the Qur'an claims the <a href="wiki/Corruption_of_Previous_Scriptures_(Qur'an_2-79).html" title="Corruption of Previous Scriptures (Qur'an 2:79)">corruption of previous scriptures</a>. However with this erroneous belief comes a new set of problems.
</p><p>The Qur'an says in 15:9, &quot;We have revealed the <i>dhikr</i> (reminder) and we surely will preserve it,&quot; but which &quot;reminder&quot; is Allah referring to, and who decided it only applied to Qur'anic text? 
</p><p>The <a href="wiki/Taurat.html" title="Taurat">Taurat</a> and <a href="wiki/Injil.html" title="Injil">Injil</a> are also referred to as <i>dhikr</i> in 21:48, 21:7, and 40:53-54. So if Allah could not protect these <i>dhikrs</i> as he promised in 15:9, how can we expect him to protect the last <i>dhikr</i>? 
</p><p>Allah said he will preserve the <i>dhikr</i>, either he preserves all the <i>dhikr</i> (Taurat, Injil, and Qur'an) or None.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>What have we learnt here? We have learnt that some verses are missing, some readings are different, and the very best scholars and reciters of Islam, whom Muhammad himself had approved of, rejected the Qur'an of Uthman. 
</p><p>What are we left with? We are left with a very human text, as prone to corruption as any other medieval text, and Muslims who deny this are left holding an untenable position.
