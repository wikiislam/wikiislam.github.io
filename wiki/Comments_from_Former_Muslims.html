<div class="quotes">I left Islam after being skeptical for years. I did thorough research and had discussion with countless religious people and listened to many lectures by noble muslim preachers, and ironically still doing so. I just can't live with thinking that it is okay to see others as people with less rights than me, even in the claimed &quot;after-life&quot;. I could never see any religion anything more than a system of thoughts that was laid down by a great thinker and evolved from previous philosophies. As long as my brain is on, I won't give up to myths.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Tareq Sharafy, 24, Israel, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I used to be a good Muslim until I grew up and searched for the truth. I learnt a lot about Islam as I'm in the most populated Islamic country. Thanks to the internet I found many facts against what I have been previously taught before by Islamic scholars. I found that Islam is full of fallacies and leads to insane and satanic behavior, really inhumane and crazy. Then I started thinking and decided that everyone is born as an atheist. I do hope that god exists but I can't deny that god is not, well, at least I don't have the proof so else millions like me. So I will just keep my eyes of mind open to think and live my life free from burden dogmas. 
Thanks to WikiIslam and all atheists, agnostics, and secular humanists for keeping up the fight against terrorism and educating those who are blinded by faith.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Gon Candu, 33, Indonesia, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">When I came in touch with the sites faithfreedom.org, islamwatch.org, wikiislam.net, mukto-mona.com, I started to think differently. These sites helped me to find the gaps of all religion including Islam.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Fawad Ahmed, 23, Bangladesh, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I left Islam because of my sister. She refused to accept a rival wife to share her husband. This was an eye-opener to me. Other factors which made me to hate Islam were the oppression of women and the killing of innocent people in south of Sudan in the name of Jihad.<br><br>I have written a novel which reveals the cruelty of Islam towards women. It is called: Intisar: A Story of a Muslim Girl.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Dr. A.A.Ahmed, Sudan, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was born and raise a Muslim. My father had no problem with delivering harsh beatings on me for making mistakes when he was teaching me the Quran. Naturally, I spent the first 14 years of my life thinking that this was the true religion, and that I would go to hell. I was always convinced that Islam was true due to the 'Quran miracle claims' which were all over the web, which satisfied me into thinking that I was definitely following the true religion, despite the fact that, being the fool I was at the time, I had not even bothered to READ the 'miracle claims'. 
<p>Ironically, it was Wikiislam that caused me to have doubts about my faith. I stumbled upon it while searching for information about my religion, and decided to 'have a look round'. I came across the page detailing scientific errors in the Quran. Being the naive person I was, I couldn't believe that the 'Holy' Quran would have scientific errors. I began investigating further into these errors, and I soon found that these WERE genuine errors, meaning that the Quran was indeed false. Therefore, I secretly declared myself an apostate, and became a supporter of Ali Sina, Richard Dawkins and the Council of Ex Muslims. 
</p>
Ultimately, I am glad that I have left Islam, and am happy at the freedom I now have since leaving this religion. I would like to thank Wikiislam for providing me with the turning point in my life, and giving me the information I needed to leave this awful Religion.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Lord Demahom, 14, United Kingdom, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">9/11 probably opened my eyes. I realized that Islam at its best couldn't re-invent itself or adapt to the changing world. I realized also, its the reason for all failures of Arabs and Muslims. Yet Islam is apologetic to every medieval notion, the way it treats women, other non-believers and religions, solving simple problems of life other than Halal/Haraam and just branding others as blasphemous. This religion goes against my mind and values, that is why I left it.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Zaheer Ahmad, 29, Pakistan, now a Catholic Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was always questioning shariah law and several Islamic law toward women such in heritage, polygamy, full obedience toward husband, etc. But my clerics always said that it's only Allah knows what is real justice and fairness. Basically they said that I should not trust my conscience....
<p>Then I was disturbed about some news about acid attacks to women in many Islamic countries just because they wanted to go to school, do not obey their parents or husband, I said enough is enough. I use google to find the answers and somehow I found this website. Everything becomes really clear to me that actually that's how the Muhammad's teaching. Violence towards women is actually part of Islamic way of life even during Muhammad's era. I opened my collection of Islamic literatures, surprisingly, they confirmed what is written in this website.
</p>
I was a shock revelation really. I feel cheated. After all these years of suffering just to find our that my religion is false...<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Revelation, 50, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I read the material in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/debates.htm">debates section</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://news.faithfreedom.org/index.php?name=News&catid=&topic=17?name=News&catid=&topic=17">2</a> of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/">faithfreedom.org</a>. It was enough to see that Islam is not a divinely inspired religion. Since the Qur'an has been shown to contain errors of anatomy, geography, history, biology, astronomy, grammar, logic etc. it cannot be from God.
<p>If there are so many errors it must be man-made. So if the Quran is man-made, then the whole Islamic religion is man-made. While I believe God could exist, He may also be just human mental construct. I do not know, so I am an Agnostic. I am open to further information to prove it one way or the other.
</p>
I found numerous Qur'an chapters (Surahs) to be extremely hateful and violent. Thus if being a Muslim means I cannot have friendships with Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists or Atheists, etc then I do not want Islam to imprison me. I love Muslims but I hate Islam.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Bread, China, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I used to be a devout Muslims, until I started reading the six Hadiths (Al-Kutub al-Sittah). As I read, I realized that sociopath could not be a Prophet of God. In most religions God is good, God wants love, God wants peace. The God of the Qur'an does not. He wants death, war, and hatred. I know this by what is written about Muhammad in the Hadiths and Qur'an. 
<p>Fight and kill the disbelievers, slay and are slain, kill and are killed, Fight those who do not believe until they all surrender, paying the protective tax in submission, Muslims, fight in Allah's Cause, Fight them until all opposition ends and all submit to Allah, So fight them until there is no more Fitnah, Fight the unbelievers around you, and let them find harshness in you. 
</p>
Looking back this looked so normal to me, so necessary.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Mohammad, 26, Pakistan, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I just used common sense to move away from religion. I was born in a Muslim family, hence I was a Muslim till I became an adult. Had I been born under any other religion, I would've been a follower of the same. And all my life I heard that Muslims would have the first right to heaven. That sounded very absurd to me and as my brain opened up i realized it was not my achievement of being born in a Muslim family that I had a birth right to heaven. Surely God cannot be so unfair. Furthermore, the history of Islam is full of bloodshed and war, and the Quran clearly allows jihad on one side and then says all humans are equal. Surely God could not reveal such hypocritical statements and I openly challenge the validity of the book. I am a God fearing human who believes every human is equal, be he/she from any religion, caste or creed. I freely choose not to follow Islam anymore as the concept is against my altruistic views on life, where a persons life and faith should be governed by his/her own free mind and logical reasoning. Not by the way of birth or what the ancestors have always believed in.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Arsalan Chatha, 24, Pakistan, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I left Islam. I always thought that Muhammad can not be God's messenger or a holy man! By looking at his personal affairs, especially with women, I can not follow a man who marries each woman he meets! Also the contradictions in the Quran and the way it was written - in a way that is so difficult to understand, made me believe that this is a man made religion . Also, Islam has NO tolerance for other belief systems, and the argument that Muslims are very lucky that they were born in Muslim countries got me convinced that Muslims are so closed-minded and forgot that there are many wonderful people on this planet who are not Muslims. I think Islam is the worst thing that happened to humanity. It pushes Muslim's backwards and that is why there is no single Muslim country is advanced or even civilized! Also on the question of prayer, they say if you do not pray 5 times a day you will be burned in hell for ever! I tried prayer of course when I was a Muslim, but I did not feel anything, I felt I am just exercising or in the Gym, I felt I am like a robot. No feeling at all. This is pure brainwashing.
Now I am not sure if there is God or Not, the theory of evolution blew my mind and the fact that there are so many religions in the world and so many problems in the world made me believe that Man created God not the other way around. <br> <div class="quotes_ref">Hussein, Egypt, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The reason I left Islam is mainly Islam's attitude toward free thinking. I mean, if Islam is a religion standing on a very solid ground, and that it is absolutely convincing and the righteous religion as it claims, then why threaten those who would think of leaving it and scare them with Hell and Fire and blah blah blah?!! It's like saying &quot;I'm right, I know you would follow me, this is the only logical thing to do,&quot; and then two day later saying &quot;Don't you EVER think of deserting me or I'll burn you IN HELL!&quot; This is pathetic and stupid!
<p>This is only one reason, not to mention wife-beating, degrading of women, and the many restraints and unneeded rules! And the reasons go on and on and on...
</p>
I'm now an atheist.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Mamduh (Prince of Egypt), Egypt, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">As for me, becoming just a servant of god is not something that can be proud of, but, having an ambition to be one of god's sons, is, the supreme pride for all creation on Earth and Sea. And for this, the majority of the Christians do have the same thoughts as me. You can't tell unless you tried it first and he or she has to be entitled for all the deeds in the day of the resurrection. The day what being so-called as the day where all men and women will rise and that day is the here after. 
Learning from my past experience there must be agencies that take fully responsibilities for all new apostates of Islam worldwide; especially in the Islamic countries. Not just only relying on the church or the temple or maybe perhaps the cathedral to perform such activities, as it is the place for worship and not for dealing with or battling problems. So as for this, I called upon all empowered men and women worldwide to take this movement and make this new idea to be practiced professionally as soon as possible.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shamal, Malaysia, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was tired of living a lie - of pretending to be straight, of praying and reading the Quran in Arabic; a language I didn't understand. Tired of being offered bribes by my mother to pray, just so that SHE can go to heaven, tired of being part of a group of people who seem to be saying and doing things that even they don't fully understand; of being pressured to believe in things or explanations that just doesn't make any sense. I was just tired of being herded around like a flock of dumb sheep. 
While I respect the idea that religion might be good for some people, I don't think that religion is for everyone. In a lot of instances, religion seems to be the root cause for hatred, bigotry, war, and human atrocities. People can have their religion as long as they don't shove in my face,<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Degheygh, Malaysia, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I knew all along that Islam was not a religion of peace. In fact it is not a religion at all, but a cult inciting hatred and violence. Even at a very young age of just 10 or 12 years I could not understand the notion of having a personal god. We don't really need one, especially not a sadistic Allah! <br> <div class="quotes_ref">Arshad Ahmed, India, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I left because of the hate and intolerance. I wanted to marry a Christian woman, but my family didn't allow it. They tried to kill me because I didn't want to marry the woman they had chosen. I fled with my wife to the south, which is a war zone! We felt safe there??? irony. As I have grown, the changes that have happened in my country are built on hate. When in Kenya with my wife, which is where I live now, I had a chance to read the Koran myself what I found was shocking. The biggest was the falsehoods that had been told to me as a child about Christian and other belief systems, and the continual tread of any form of natural justice in this book such as forgiveness and understanding of others. I am now a happy person I have a educated confident wife and this is the first time i have been open about my conversion.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sadamn Refos, Sudan, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">After actually getting around to reading the Qur'an in English (N.J.Dawood), realized what was in this book. I had tried to read other translations with Arabic text, but found it difficult due to the restrictions put upon the reader. To me it seems like parts of the Qur'an had been copied from the BIBLE and a lot of the chapters were just repeating the same message over and over again. I had of course gone through the whole process of learning about Islam and the do's and don’ts and had always tried to practice it but always was struggling as if I was forever carrying a great load on my back, as if I was in a prison. After I left I felt as if I had just been released from Prison.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sinbad, India, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The reasons of applying double standards, hypocrisy, bullying, aggression, uncritical analysis and phobia of all other religions and values are the start of a rather long list about why I left Islam. If I had regularly experienced the peace and tolerance Muslims claim are an important aspect of their religion, I probably would never have left- but I heard too many adults discussing the depravity of non-believers &amp; Christians and the evil nature of Jews. And the Koran seems to be obsessed about non-believers, nearly more than any other issue. I couldn't take the hatred and dislike of 'others' anymore, so gradually struggled out of the suffocating embrace of Islam. And God, do I feel good. 
Additional comments: My advice to anyone contemplating leaving Islam; give yourself a secret non-Muslim name, to be used whenever you can without endangering yourself. It is quite liberating.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Lyalpuri, Pakistan, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I don't see anything in Islam which makes sense to me.
<p>I was born and have been raised in Muslim family, although we are pretty liberal Muslims. Leaving Islam still seems to be a big and a quite risky step. My parents will be disappointed in me. That is the only reason which I will keep my decision secret as long as my parents are alive.
</p><p>Approximately two years ago I started to think critically about Islam.
I began to read articles and books critical of Islam.
</p><p>If one thinks critically and rationally about Islam one will see that Qur'an is a self made book. Besides, some of Mohammad's actions are not acceptable for a rational person who reckons human dignity and respect for fellow human which is most important.
</p>
If one doesn't consider Mohammad as a prophet and the Quran as a divine book, then there is not much to believe in. Therefore I left Islam and I believe in humanity.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Yama, Afghanistan, now a Humanist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I disagree with certain things:
<ol><li> Cutting of hands</li>
<li> Stoning to death</li>
<li> Killing of non-Muslims is “jihad”</li>
<li> Non-Muslims will not enter heaven</li>
<li> How a man age of 50 can sleep with a 9 year old girl.</li></ol>
Get rid off Islam. It’s a religion of fear and sex <br> <div class="quotes_ref">Akhtar Hussain, Pakistan,  now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Well, I never understood what kind of an insecure God wants me to worship him 5 times a day, in a language I don’t speak, to a place called Makkah. Technically, its not even worship, because worship is voluntary. This God wants you to do it or else you burn up in hell.
<p>I enjoy drinking and going out with girls, which, surprise surprise, Islam seems to have a problem with. I do <i>not</i> enjoy being told what to do and how to live, and the fact that Islam says a woman is worth half a man.
</p>
Islam is as flawed as all other religions, except Satanism, which isn’t really a religion - it basically says: Enjoy life and don’t waste it worshiping thin air.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">§ting, Pakistan, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was never really into Islam much but when I was 12 years old I suddenly started questioning.
<p>I started asking the anti-questions. How was God created if everything needs to be created and that was the start of my atheism.
</p>
Since that day no one has answered my question and I have remained a humble atheist.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sabih Bob, Pakistan, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">What is Islam? How did I know it? The answer is I was born into a Muslim family. I used to believe in the Arabian Bedouins’ Fairy Tale “Quran”. I did not even know it well. When I was 16, I asked myself why Islam is so aggressive. Since then I started to read the Quran in English, I stopped trusting Muslims’ folk stories and the Qur'an. Later on, in April 2003, I found websites such as FFI. I found that the Qur'an is a textbook of terrorism, and Islam is always bloody. In April, 2003, my doubts about Islam came true. So, I am not a fool or stupid enough to believe the Fairy Tale “Quran” by not having read it. My suspicion about Islam began at the age of 16 and I left the religion of peace at the age of 21- I am really proud of this. I will show up here with my pen in near future.
Additional comments: Watch out for pure Muslims. They would not mind to do Jihad on you guys.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Imran Hossain, Bangladesh, now a Humanist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Hello, I found your site a few weeks ago on the internet. I am impressed and really feel happy that you are trying to educate Muslims. I was born in a Muslim family and was a practicing Muslim until I read the Koran. When I read the Koran for the first time, I was terrified because of its threatening language. On the next Ramadan, I read the Koran again and finally discovered that it is nothing but a book used to confuse and terrify people so that they obey it and do not question. 
<p>I have been in the UK for last 5 years. This opportunity to live in a free society gave me a chance to analyze Islam without any influence of a Mullah. Obviously I do not say things against Islam openly as I know someone desperate to go to heaven, or someone desperate for having sex with 70 women in heaven will just kill me but however I always try to educate people who are willing to listen. I shall be grateful to you if you kindly give me permission to copy and reproduce some material from your site, not for publication but just to show it to a few Muslims who do not have access to the internet. 
</p>
Regards<br> <div class="quotes_ref">K A S, United Kingdom, current worldview unknown </div></div>
<div class="quotes">Islam is pain, suffering, deception, wolf in sheep's clothing. It doesn't make sense, it never did! I think this explains why I've never had an interest in reciting the holy Quran since I was a child. I knew that someday I would come across this kind of site(the first one I know is FFI) and it has opened up my eyes and my mind entirely on the true face of Islam. Islam is truly based on second hand stories and not facts and reasons. So Muslims, wake up! Open your eyes. Realize that you have been indoctrinated by some crazy old Arab guy who was just crazy for lust and power.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Dhimmiologist, Malaysia, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Why I left Islam:
<ol><li> Self-righteousness of the followers of Islam.</li>
<li> The Muslim's belief in the superiority of Islam and hatred for others.</li>
<li> Islam's cult-like expectation of unquestioning faith in its teachings.</li>
<li>  Lack of tolerance of Islam and its followers.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Jay McAdam, Pakistan</div></li></ol></div>
<div class="quotes">Islam or I can say, all the world religions are just made up to rip people off. Religion is just a mind control drug to use and control people - and Islam is worse than all of them - after Hinduism, which I think is worse. Islam has its own evilness, from gender discrimination, inhuman punishments, unscientific, etc. In short, all the religions are basically the same fruit but with different colors.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Naxus, Pakistan, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I left Islam, the religion of my forefathers at the age of 17. I was born out of wedlock and throughout my growing up years, I heard that we will never go to heaven simply because of what our parents had done. I asked myself is it my fault? I don't blame my parents for doing what they had done..after I became a christian, my Muslim friends told me that I've created a big sin of which my mother will have to bear the sins that I've done. It's not her fault. It's my choice..<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Dom, Singapore, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I should say that I left religion in general. I came to realize how much humanity is suffering because of our reliance on supernatural power to help us, rather than taking our destiny in our own hands. Not believing in the supernatural has lifted a great burden off my shoulders and I feel a sense of freedom I never felt before.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Mohammad Reza, Iran, now a Humanist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I left Islam because I grew up with it, and I am totally aware of how nasty it is. Islam destroyed my country - Iran - about 1400 years ago as soon as they gained power. Muslims attacked us, raped our women and destroyed our culture and country because they wanted us to change our religion to their fucking shit, Islam. Many years later, in 1979, another Islamic regime took power in Iran. Again, they did exactly the same things. Later on, when I did more in-depth research about Islam, I found out that Mohammad was a terrorist himself; he killed and raped a lot of people! I even read somewhere that he was Gay! Look at his followers who are leaders in Iran - they are gay terrorists, a bunch of animals. We Iranians hate Islam. We have suffered at the hands of Islam throughout our history. That’s more than enough of Islam for us. We will remove all Islamic traces from our country as soon as we can get rid of our evil Islamic government.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Hadi, United Kingdom, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">It has been a long time, I am studying the characteristics of the countries and the people who have a religious government instead of a secular one. It has been obvious to me that in all the religions, beliefs and new modern adoptable conveniences, there are many obligations without any sold reasons and their consequences. Why should we follow some commands without any clarifications about them? I found that in the most of them, we can find many lessons that you can learn in order to live a better life and contribute to a better society. Most of these are common in different religions. The rest of the rules and commands are the way to hold the people under control; to obey the leaders; and, in this way, guarantee their societal coherence. I think that we must also respect religious people, because they believe in something that they can not prove, and we do not believe something that we can not accept to be present because there is no evidence of it. An apostate is also somebody who believes something.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Reza, Belgium, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">My experience was that Islam is the most incompatible, intimidating and fearsome religion I have come to know. I was brought up as a Muslim and I denounced it as soon as I developed the confidence to question it. I hope that one day all humankind can transcend the barriers and chains that religion imposes, and I await with glee the day that Islam as a religion, has diminished to nothing but a distant memory - when our children of tomorrow can dismiss Islam as a religion of a bygone age.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Khalique, United Kingdom, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">There's nothing to be said: Islam is full of bullsh#t nonsense and there's no reasonable person, who can understand the stupid language of the Qur'an, that can bear to stay in such religion for more than 2 seconds. Also, the ethical behavior of the so-called Prophet of Islam &quot;7amada&quot; - he was a bastard who needed nothing more than SEX &amp; Murdering. So, to hell with that ideology I would kill myself first.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Exhausted Mind, Egypt</div></div>
<div class="quotes">To make a long story short, I was really put off by the cruelty in the Koran and I was also disgusted by the actions of the so called &quot;prophet&quot;. Another thing that really shook my belief was this verse in the Koran (Qur'an 5:116 - And when Allah saith: O Jesus, son of Mary! Didst thou say unto mankind: Take me and my mother for two gods beside Allah ?). I knew the Christian trinity didn't include Jesus' mother, and when I asked why I was told to shut up. After being told over and over the Koran is perfect, I had proof it wasn't! 
<p>Another thing that turned me away was the Islamic concept of predestination. How can Allah destine me to go to hell and be sent to hell when I really couldn't help but me &quot;bad&quot;. Is Allah really merciful who gives justice to all? The final straw was the contradictions on the Koran. I saw as many as three contradictions in just one verse! Is that what Muhammad called &quot;perfect&quot;?

<div class="quotes">By birth and by Moroccan fascist Muslim law, I lived as a moderate Muslim all my life until I took the time to read the Quran - and be honest with myself. I was shocked to find out that the Qur'an (Mohamed's Mein Kampf! was full of nothing but repetitive garbage, hatred, lies, contradictions, luring and threatening verses. When I read stuff like: man (not woman) will get virgins and even good-looking boys in heaven, men may beat their wives if these refuse to obey them, when I found out that a 54 year old pedophilic Mohamed slept with an 8 year old Aisha, when I found out how Islam was actually spread (through violence, murder, rape etc to North Africa, Persia etc), and when I read about all the violence and techniques of torturing/killing non-Muslims, and the hatred the Quran preaches towards Jews, and the list is endless. I KNEW I WAS WORSHIPING A MAN/EVIL NAMED MUHAMMAD, BUT WHO WAS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO HAVE A GOD (ALLAH) SERVE HIM AND SERVE HIS CAUSE. 
<p>Mohamed &quot;wrote&quot; the Qur'an, he used Allah so that people fear him.

Islam does preach violence against non-Muslims: &quot; Islam toslam&quot;: become Muslim and you'll be left alone. Islam's goal is to recreate an Islamic ummah like the one that Mohamed and his buddies started in the 7th century.

<div class="quotes">I have always felt there is something wrong with Islam, ever since I was a little girl. I have never thought it right that a man should have four wives, I was traumatized by my circumcision. I was rebellious that my religion tells me that the moral police have rights over my body, with regards to being with men, what I chose to wear, and what beverage I prefer. When I decided enough was enough, I was outraged that I did not have rights to get a divorce, after years of mental abuse by my ex-husband. I am saddened by Muslims mentality with regards to women having to be obedient to their husbands, and vice versa is not expected of the husband. That women can only stand by and watch their husbands take two, or three other wives. I am saddened by Muslims' hypocrisy, and their tendency to interfere, and make judgments on another person.

<div class="quotes">Well its a long story really and I don't know where to begin ,so to make a long story short. I started having seeds of doubt so to speak ever since I was born. After a long period of research; reading and personal experiences, I realized that Islam or the belief in it is completely irrational , illogical and just utter garbage. Keep in mind that I was raised according to Islamic traditions and customs, studied the Quran and hadith in elementary school right up until high school, and am also living in a 100% Islamic community. Nevertheless, I have manged somehow to resist all this brainwashing and think for my self for once. 
I haven't met anybody in my community who even has the slightest doubt in Islam to this very day and it really amazes me I cant figure out how they can still have solid faith and carry on I guess logic and reason is dead in this part of the world and religion ((any religion)) is truly the opinion of the masses.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Rational Khalid, Saudi Arabia, now a Nihilist </div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was born and grew up in Islamic family. At the age of 15, I joined an Islamic preaching organization an after that I observed almost all of Islamic jihadi organizations working in Pakistan. I was a fundamentalist Muslim. First I started thinking about different sects of Islam, which one is right? I studied the Qur'an, the ahadith and Fiqh thoroughly. Then I realized that there is something wrong with my beliefs. I started studying other religions too; and I discussed religion with Islamic scholars, Muftis - as well as scholars of other religions too. It took more than a whole year of depression and fear, but finally I left religion. I am an Atheist now. Like all other apostates of Islam I can't express my beliefs and feelings openly, and I am facing a lot of hardships and difficulties.

<div class="quotes">I live and work in Malaysia and became a Muslim for the sole purpose of marrying a woman I loved who for obvious reasons could not marry me otherwise. She was well aware of my thoughts on the subject and the circumstances. My acceptance of Islam involved nothing more than saying the profession of faith and signing a piece of paper, no circumcision or religious instruction, I've never been in a mosque, as far as I'm concerned I left Islam the day I joined it. 3 years later I find myself in a Shariah court divorcing this lady and trying to figure out some way I can protect my 30 month old daughter from from being used as a pawn in this situation and having to suffer the damage that being bought up with this stifling religious nonsense inflicts, missing out on so much that life has to offer.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Sharky, Malaysia, now an agnostic</div></div>

<div class="quotes">On my own volition I converted to Islam in 1993. As a typical Muslim convert I became quite observant, I learned the Qur'an, spent a lot of time at the Masjid, started hanging out with some fellows from the Tabliq Jamat and at one point in enthusiasm for my new faith, I was ready to go to Bosnia to fight the Serbs. While studying the Hadiths and the biography of Muhammad, I came across some pretty shocking stories. Soon after I admitted to myself that it was impossible that a man with so little scruples could be a Prophet of God; so I left Islam soon after.
I still have many Muslim friends and my wife is a Muslim of South Asian background. She knows of my apostasy and has taken it very hard(her father leads Friday prayers at the Mosque)<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Steuart, United Kingdom, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Converted to Islam and I was only shown the good side. I was encouraged not to question the pointlessness of some rules i.e. grow a beard,wear Arab dress - even being told to remove family pictures and get rid of my dog. I began to feel that I was damned to hellfire alongside my non-Muslim wife, as I could not follow all the restrictions perfectly. I also could not give up drinking the occasional beer or looking at pretty women. Why do Muslimah's have to cover up? Why should I hate my gay friends? 
It was beginning to make me depressed and my family miserable. I had closed my mind and it hurt. After more study and much thought, I have broken away from the Muslim's I knew, and feel liberated from this mental slavery. But I am very careful and hope my constant excuses for not meeting them will stop them contacting me before they ask my reasons for avoiding them. I feel I made a mistake in converting and worry about consequences of leaving.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Talib, United Kingdom, now a Humanist</div></div>

<div class="quotes">I was born into a very religious Islamic family. My parents wanted me to be an Imam. I moved to Mumbai and, as I grew up, I began to mix with Hindus, Christians, and Jews. While in Mumbai I began to start reading the Qur'an and I realized that it was full of horrible deeds and lies and hypocrisy. Later on, I started to learn about other religions such as Hinduism and Christianity. On the 23rd of March 2003 I finally decided that Islam was not the religion of peace but it encouraged violence, polygamy, slavery and pedophilia. I attended a Church mass and was Baptized as an Anglican. About one month later my friends and family found out, my parents wouldn't speak to me and I received death threats. I feared for my life and moved to New Zealand.

<div class="quotes">I was born in the Maldives, where all citizens are forced to adhere to Islam to maintain the so-called 100% Muslim character of the country. Brainwashed by what I had been told by my parents, I had no reason in early childhood to doubt the truth of Islam. I faced the moment of truth when I was in 7th grade in high school. I got an English translation of the Quran, and read it with great expectations, looking for infinite wisdom. But what I saw in the book was incoherence and stupidity. Thereafter, I did a systemic study of all material on Mohammed and Islam available to me and satisfied myself that the religion was not just stupid, but dangerously stupid. 
In the Maldives, it is dangerous to let anyone know that you are not a Muslim.

<li>Has no respect for humanity</li>
<li>It was established on violence and killing after 23 battles</li>
<li> The Quran is full of scientific historical numerical errors that are very obvious.</li>

After 3 years in the faith, I realized that it didn’t solve any of my problems, nor is it the truth. The Sahih Ahadith are testament to the lie that is Islam, and the liar that is Mohammed - who actually sanctioned the murder of two innocent poets. Mohammed was simply a smart man, who after some persecution, got ahead of himself, and went on a rampage, in Al Madinah.

I accept Jesus in my life and I left Islam.

Thus began the quest to look for &quot;the other view&quot; on Islam.

Muslim is not taught to be good or moralized person, he or she merely motivated by heaven and hellfire. Conscience does not exist in Islam. It is fear based religion.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Indonesian, Indonesia, now a Kejawen</div></div>
<div class="quotes">It's neurotic to believe and follow regulations that are tailored for 7th century even they would have been working back then.. Islam is based on the thought that a person shall get perfect by deeds and constant halal/haram assessments. You need Islam everywhere even in your bed and in the toilet. The good deeds for their part don't even count as &quot;good&quot; but neurotic (praying in Arabic, washing, eating in some manner, walking in one manner, denying some normal or enjoyable things as listening to music). In addition some of those rules and even ideals are against human rights, lack individual freedom, the ideal of equality of both sexes in decision making. Furthermore, Islam inspires people to be suspicious and intolerant, even racist towards other religions and encourage to so called narrow thinking. There is no pure and unconditional love, love and hate is for the sake of Allah and hence, love's not free and real but must follow Allah's rules. I really dislike animistic habits the effect of which has no logical explanation, I cannot accept inequality and suppression of sexes and praising of martyrs, and cannot categorize people according to their religion and limit anybody or my own freedom. Also, I don't think sex must be related to each and any communication and cloth. I want to be me, praise my Lord with music and singing, be independent, express myself, make decisions...etc..<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Friend, Finland</div></div>

<div class="quotes">When I was 14, I began to realize how profoundly different Islam was from what I had been taught about it. I had been told that it is a religion of peace, democracy, scientific progress, humanism, etc. But it started to become clear to me that what I have been taught during my first 14 years of indoctrination was nothing but a lie generated by Muslim scholars to cover Islam's ass. I began to notice significantly ignorant and superstitious Islamic claims that include: the prohibition of music and art, the oppression of women, the lawfulness of slavery, the belief in other superstitious statements like witchcraft and demonic possession, etc. By the time I turned 15 I began to seriously doubt that the Quran is the word of God, mainly due to my realization of the scientific as well as historical errors in its context. However, I did hold on to the idea that the universe could not have created itself from nothing, therefore believing in a creator deity. Finally, I started to see how the latter claim is explicable, by the laws of quantum physics and string theory (as well as the emergence of life according to the Theory of Evolution). These creation myths in religion no longer meant anything to me. What is God then? If the universe had to have been created by a supernatural creator, doesn't that also mean God must have been created? Who created God's creator then, Ad Infinitum... The idea that before the Big Bang, time didn't exist also made more sense than God having existed forever. That is why the Big Bang Theory is such a profound scientific and reasonable claim.

I found these scriptures to be illogical, irrational, anti-humanity and truly a threat to the rest of the world. Now, I am an atheist and have been studying more about science which back up my claims. I feel like I am in peace with this universe and I am a free man now, slave to no-one.

<div class="quotes">I just got tired of being asked to believe things that didn't make any sense to me. Here is a short list of these:

<div class="quotes">When I was 12 I started becoming interested in religion and so I found Islam. At the time I lived in a small town (now I live in the big city Cracow) so there were no immigrants so no Muslims. I relied on the Internet to talk to Muslims. I did my research, read some of the Quran (I ended up being bored because it just repeats &quot;Allah is this, Allah is that!&quot; most of the time) and truly believed in this. I hadn't realized what a radical and fundamentalist religion this is. When asked about extremists I used the typical Islamic excuse &quot;They're not real Muslims&quot;. After a few months, I stopped being so religious, but still called myself Muslim.
But after 6 months, I started to realize how extremist Islam can be. I saw a bunch of YouTube videos of adulterous women being stoned in Saudi Arabia, gays being hang in Iran, apostates beheaded in Afghanistan, etc. I had a serious doubt in Islam at this point. This website has also played a big part on my road back to Christianity. I started reading more about my birth religion, Roman Catholicism and overall Christianity.

I also discussed it with many people with different viewpoints from my own, especially communists and atheists.

I guess this is kind of what started my interest in the matter. I knew Islam was an Arabic religion, and considering how the Arabs had treated my people, I couldn't really find myself in anything of it. When I started reading into it in one of Mombasa's many libraries, I found out some more choking truths about Islam. Including the slavery, especially of African women, who were used as sex slaves for Arabic merchants. I shared my discoveries with my parents, but they didn't really seem to think about what I said. As time progressed, I realized all the hardship Islam and Muslims have caused Africa, and my people in particular. From just viewing it in an ethnocentric manner, it kind of grew on me as a criticism of islam as a religion overall. I couldn't find anything positive about it in the end of the day. Islam feels cold and inhuman for me. Today I am trying to turn to Buddhism, I say TRY because it is indeed hard.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Malik Adewa, 25, Sudan, now a Buddhist</div></div>

(Mis)Treatment of women, homosexuals, slaves, apostates, etc. The philosophical justification of the existence of the Islamic deity is also very flimsy. After a while of first doubting the infallibility of the Shi'ite Imams, followed by doubts about the infallibility of Muhammad himself, and then doubts about the historical accuracy of the Qur'an, I became a Deist.

When I came to Europe I watched on TV the Pope of the Catholic Church in Italy who had been praying for Somalia when severe drought hit. This made me compare my ex-imam in Somalia and the Pope. I found that the Pope is the more kinder and generous of the two. After that, I decided to look for a religion that contained some humanity.

At first when I began to learn about Islam and decided to convert, my views became very anti-American. This was due to ignorance and naivety on my part. Eventually, I moderated my beliefs and that was when I began wearing the hijab; getting involved at the mosque, and praying/fasting - although I only fasted one time, as I was only Muslim for about a year. The more I learned, the more brainwashed I became. However, I soon began to realize that there were indeed inequalities in this religion, as well as contradictions. As painful as it was, I renounced my faith after a lot of thinking and soul searching.

At this point I have come to realize that spirituality and religion are two different schools of thought and one does not have to involve the other. I started studying paganism, and found it far more empowering to women then any other major religion I have encountered.

Women have suffered all over the world in the name of God and culture, it's about time we put an end to this and elevate the Goddess Within each and every women. Blessed Be!!

<div class="quotes">Although I had had doubts since I was in my teens about the divinity of Islamic teachings, the straw that broke camel's back was reading about what is really in Quran and what Muhammad did in his Medina stay through websites like FaithFreedom.org and books by Ibn Warraq and Anwar Shaikh. Particularly disgusting was his massacre of all Quraiza tribesmen and taking beautiful Rehana - the wife of the tribe leader - to bed the same night; and sex with 17 year old Safia after killing her husband Kinana and his people in Khyber. Other disturbing revelations were Muhammad's marriage to 6 year old Ayesha, his sleeping with slave girls and concubines,his assassinations of his critics, the Quran's declaration of violence against non-Muslims, raping of captive women and slaves &amp; looting of non Muslims as pious act worthy of paradise. That left no doubt in my mind that Islam is not divine, it is a dangerous cult.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ayesha Ahmed, India, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was a Saudi muslim. I have read and understood the teaching of Islam since elementary school and I have been given high doses of the Quran and ahadith, but I could not be convinced to believe in everything. It is simply because it is against logic and science. Thanks.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shitan, Saudi Arabia</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I was forced into Islam because I was underage and because of my father who thought it can help him in his work. I have longed and wished to be a Christian since I was in Primary school, but I had to wait until I was old enough to decide for myself. My dad never forced me or helped me to learn about the Islamic religion. We never even talked about it. I am disappointed there is still a religion like this forcing apostate to remain as a Muslim. Only God can decide one's life and only he can decide we live or die. The law is written by people. Shouldn't we discard what is not applicable to this century instead of killing or forcing people just because of something that is written a long time ago. Cruelty should not be a religion. The world will have no peace if we fight just because of some holy scripts written by our forefathers.

<div class="quotes">There are many reasons why I left Islam, but the biggest was the violence and hate! I didn't realise how much hate was in the Quran until I actually read it page by page! Also I didn't get any respect, even though I tried my best to be a good Muslim. I lived in Egypt and I saw first hand how the Mullahs in the village mosques were spreading hate! I also couldn't be proud to call myself a Muslim especially when a lot of child abuse goes on in Islamic countries and hypocrisy!<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Amanda Ueta, United Kingdom, now a Jew</div></div>
<div class="quotes">If I believed in God and Satan, I would be sure that Islam is the religion of Satan, and Muslims are devil-worshipers. Of course, most Muslims are not evil by nature. Most of my friends still call themselves Muslims because they identify the religion with their cultural roots. However, they have no clue what the religion is truly about, and will probably never find out as they don't bother to attend mosque or read the Quran. In the end, these friends are actually apostates like me. 
They just have never bothered to label themselves as such due to complacency or disinterest. What scares me is not this multitude of quasi-Muslims, but the multitude of real Muslims. They are the one's that can do the damage. I left Islam after listening to a few of them speak at a CAIR convention. They horrified me with their hatred and bigotry. I went straight home and researched the religious reasoning behind their words. I was shocked to find out that it was these hate-filled monger's who were following Islam, and not I. So now I am an apostate.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Fatima, Morocco, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I've always felt restricted among the Muslim society and my family. I stopped praying years ago. I began to realize my lack of religious belief, because I didn't feel any remorse or fear of &quot;Allah&quot; for not being a good Muslim. And when my parents or Sunday school teachers would tell me of stories and miracles of the Quran or Muhammad's life, I saw them only as childish exaggerations that didn't make sense or align with human nature. Even passages from the Quran sounded like something out of a child's book. I felt handcuffed and gagged. The times I did speak up and express my opinions to my parents, they completely freaked and then dismissed my curiosity as being of a &quot;foolish uneducated child,&quot; I was not born to submit my free will to God or any religion. I have freed myself emotionally from the bondage of religion. I count the days till I am also free physically.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Julia Potter, Egypt, now agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I don't hate Islam - that is a fact. I just couldn't find peace there. The fact that I was always punished for everything, that I have to pray 5 times a day, that I can't drink one glass of wine, can't have a boyfriend, can't wear what I want; all that just annoyed me and then the fact that most Muslims view other non Muslims as atheists and think that non Muslims will go to hell, this just doesn't seem right. To be honest, I didn't officially leave Islam because people here would kill me, but I have cut all relations to Muslims and Islam, I am going to church now, I am happy there, I am waiting till I graduate from university and leave to the states so I can officially convert.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Dima, Palestinian Authority area, now a Christian</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I struggled with myself for a few years before leaving Islam. My conscience led me out finally. Islam is a scary religion - often accepted by people with good intentions and a real lack of information. I left basically because I discovered what being a Muslim means. Had I a better understanding when I accepted Islam, I would have NEVER have converted. I believe most converts suffer from great ignorance. Good people who think freely cannot maintain peace of heart and mind in Islam. 
<p>Once I left Islam, my Muslim husband starting treating me very differently. Suddenly I didn't deserve his goodness. He once even told me that he couldn't look at me because my hair wasn't covered. Ultimately we divorced.

<div class="quotes">It all started 6 years ago when I met the man who would become my first husband. Though I respected Islam, I didn't really want to convert. The local MSA found out and promptly pushed me to &quot;save&quot; myself from sin.
<p>Needless to say, I felt I made a mistake when 2 weeks after my conversion, I was nearly raped by a Muslim man. My first marriage failed and I hastily married another Muslim man who claimed to be a Sufi. As it turns out, he was addicted to pornography and had no respect for women at all. So I came back home after a few months of marriage. Living as a Muslim was hell. I couldn't find a job because I wore a hijab and 9-11 didn't make anything easier for me.
</p><p>I met my current husband a few years ago. We suffered a lot of mistreatment at the hands of the Muslim community. Finally things got so bad we decided to save ourselves - so we left Islam.

<div class="quotes">I converted to Islam some time ago, and been a steadfast observer for four years, in which I spent much of my time extensively reading the Qur'an, and the explanations available, articles from Islamic sites, counsels given by Imams to different people on those sites and discussions between Muslims on forums. I got to know other converts and Muslim people, but slowly, I started to realize that even if i try my best to fit in, I would not be able to.
<p>I browsed for 'feminist' Islamic sites and modern-progressive Islamic sites, but they seemed to be a drop in an ocean of misunderstanding and blind following of traditions. Sometimes some explanation given to me to 'excuse' something, I would find difficult to digest, it would seem flimsy to me, but I`d just force myself to believe it. But at one moment I stopped and realized that if I could go on like this, it is not the life I would like my children to have, that if I will ever have children.
</p><p>So I stopped lying to myself, and here I am.
</p><p>I don`t think Islam is plain wrong, many people find peace and illumination in it, but I just did not find anything better than in my old beliefs, nothing inspiring.
</p>
So I quit trying.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Fatma, Romania, now a Christian </div></div>
<div class="quotes">I always had doubts ever since converting to Islam around 2 years ago. However, the turning point was when I began to learn some Judaism and Hebrew. Well, according to Islam, Jews are the enemies, so I got even more interested in the matter. I ended up realizing the illogical nature of Islamic theology, e.g. the Most Merciful G-d burning people forever just because they did not testify the authority of Muhammad. I certainly believed in G-d but when i began to realize how much arrogance, hatred and corruption Islam actually involves, I gradually moved away from my belief that Muhammad is the prophet of G-d. 
It naturally caused some problems with Muslim friends of mine but it was a step I had to take. I don't regret being Muslim for 2 years, because I learned a lot, and there was lot of good stuff in there to learn as well. Oh, and that constant labeling of people into kafirs and such. It's just unbelievable what was going on in my life.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shimon, United Kingdom, now a Jew</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Why I left Islam? Simple, I read the Koran and Sira of Mohammad for the first time in my life and realized that this cult is an insult to the dignity of all human life and intelligence. One does not have to be a scholar or an intellectual to understand that this religion is based in fear, stupidity, and bigotry. We just have to look at Islamic countries to see this. 
Three other members of my family have also apostatized for the same reasons and we are working on the remaining members by encouraging discussion and raising questions about Islamic practices and by critiquing the personality of Mohammad and his sahaba. I've seen that this helps sew the seed of doubt in people and induce further research on the subject by them who would other wise rely on so called Ulema to answer questions for them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Saba Khan, United Kingdom, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">As Muslims use to say: I was born as muslim among a religious and traditional family. But I grew up in a western country and at young age and progressivly I got interested in the real and true issues of life and sciences that I couldn't bear the darkness, hatred and cruelty neither of Islam nor any other religion. All religions are manmade because humans need something to rely on due to their fears and disability to rely on their own and on rationality. As a woman I had the &quot;delightful honour&quot; to experience the peaceableness and justice teached by Islam and it's devotees.

<div class="quotes">My parents tried to force this religion on me, but what I saw of their religious dedication was a radical and mean-spirited fanaticism that did not embody any attributes that I would ever aspire to. I never embraced Islam and have felt much pain from my parents as a result. My parents threatened to have my friends killed, they have beaten and abused me, threatened my friends and have held guns to my little sister's head when they found that she had a boyfriend. This religion is divisive and dangerous.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">NYCGIRL, United States, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I believed my life was made into a lie by the religious rules which makes nothing of me real. I found that religion had provided very little space for individualism and vast majority of the practicing Muslims were too suffocating with their need to impose their views on others. I found the religion suppressive to my level of intellectual capacity apart from devaluing my existence as a woman. I also felt there was very little room for discussions at an equal level which allows healthy respect for differences amongst Muslims when it comes to rules of God. I found the rules of God very contrived and very often lack common sense. I believe God has nothing to do with Islam, and Islam is purely one of those political ideologies which originated in the Middle East with strong Middle Eastern values which are not 100% applicable on others especially in these day and age.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ninetta, Malaysia, now an agnostic</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Getting married to a strict Muslim man made me think and leave Islam. There is a hadith that wives must be available to her husband whenever the mood struck him. &quot;I asked my husband and he told me that this was true.&quot; I realized that I could get raped because it was allowed in the Koran. I could not leave the house without my husbands permission. When I married I was forty-three years old and had a five year old son and before I became a Muslim I was independent, and I was not going to let some man tell me what I could or could not do. I decided that there was a lot of misogyny (female hatred) in Islam and I was not going to be controlled and told what and how to think by my husband or any religion. God gave me a mind to think and I feel that being a Muslim makes one stop thinking.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Awake, United States</div></div>
<div class="quotes">I entered Islam several years ago in the belief that it was a peaceful religion. Had I known it was the HOTEL CALIFORNIA.

I am happy to be out and although I lost a big support network of so called friends, I found myself again.. 
<p>If you are a Muslim wanting to get out you can do it. You need to start building a Christian network of friends and talking about it with Christians and other non Muslims. Go slow and take your time.

<div class="quotes">Islam is nothing but a headache and a biased, disrespectful, unequal religion that leaves women out, and is only beneficial for Muslim men.  Why the hell should we women cover ourselves if the men cannot control themselves? Why is it that women get the death penalty when they have made a mistake or been raped, and men get away with marrying 4 women and having sexual intercourse with 4 different women at the same time?  How does this make things equal between men and women? Islam is nothing but a whole load of bull shit (excuse my language).
Why do we have religion in the century we are in? Don't you think people have evolved and have an understanding of what is right and wrong? I totally understand why religion was there before Christ was born, and that was to lead our people to a good way of life and to be good, but why do we need it now?

It is boring and I now don't practice Islam. I asked Mohammed and Allah to help me and they did not, so I am not Muslim now.
I'm good and now I have more time to play games and do my schoolwork. I told my parents. They said nothing and so I now do not believe in Mohammed and Allah, unless he helps me.

<div class="quotes">Since I was very young, I've never liked Islam, and the reason is the way it dictates the men's treatment of women. They claim to respect women but they don't. I tried to convince myself that Islam is the right thing, but obviously I've failed. 
<p>Here are some of my experiences: 1) They say women are not free to wear what they want to wear even if they want to wear something that doesn't expose much of their bodies. They must wear the Abaya and cover their faces so that men can't look at them in a sexual way. Well, that's what I did and I got molested. 2) Women being owned by their guardian such as their father or their husband via the property deed, so Muslim women are someone's property. They are not free to do what they want to do with their lives. They can't travel, study, do surgery etc., without their guardian's approval. That cost me my education and my dream. It can't be more humiliating. These are just a few hints of how they see\treat women.

Another reason is the way they look at non-Muslims. I mean their points of view about non-Muslims is not peaceful at all, yet they continue to claim Islam is the religion of peace.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Rossa, 22, Saudi Arabia, now an atheist</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Islam attracted me it seemed so dedicated so organised. I practiced Islam for 4 years and finally left due to studying my Quran. I was so dedicated but with each study I grew further away. One quote in the Quran talks of women with big breasts in heaven as a reward for men. Once I saw that, I new this is a man made joke! I studied the Arabic day and night and soon realized the mistakes and contradictions. No God who was clever enough to make this world believes the sun orbits the earth or sperm comes from the ribs. I thank God he led me to Buddhism, what a truly wonderful way of life. It gives me purpose and meaning, it makes me happy not sad. I feel free. I work on my good deeds, not starving myself or calling others kuffar. I now understand why this life is hell and why God is so far. Islam is behind me however.

<div class="quotes">I grew up Muslim, and until the time I was 13 I never questioned it. My very first doubts came to me around that time, when I first learned what homosexuality was (though I was mainly raised in the US, my parents kept me very 'sheltered'). So after I learned what being gay was I thought it was no big deal and moved on until I realized many religious groups opposed homosexuality in general, and I though Islam possibly couldn't be the same way- well, yeah, it was and is. But I ignored it. Time went by, and as I got older I started feeling rather oppressed since the harsh rules of women in Islam started getting pushed on me (I'm actually gender non-binary, but tough luck explaining that to Muslim parents). Again, I just googled it. And...that pretty much put me off from being religious. But still, my faith persisted out of fear. I finally realized around my 15th birthday that I just couldn't ignore all the moral faults in Islam (which isn't the main reason I'm a non-Muslim today; read: no proof and scientific contradictions). I remember just crying like crazy that night, realizing that my family will never, ever accept me like this. Anyways, since then (1 and a half years ago), nobody in my family still knows (I think), and I'm just waiting for college so I can get up and leave this place so I can live a life worth living.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Vanessa, 16, Bangladesh, now an atheist</div></div>
