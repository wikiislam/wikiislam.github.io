<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>To hear groups like the Council of American-Islamic Relations or the Islamic Society of North America, one might be given the impression that <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> holds women in high regard. Indeed, Souad Saleh, a female professor at Al-Ahzar University in Cairo and a vocal proponent of women's rights in Egypt, recently stated, &quot;Islam is pure and simple, and it holds women in high esteem.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Al_Ahram_1-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-Al_Ahram-1">[1]</a></sup> For example, she says, &quot;Muslim women were the first to be granted the right to inherit property and conduct their own private business affairs. This was so at an age when the women of Europe and Asia were not allowed to own property, inherit wealth and in some instances were treated as chattel.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Al_Ahram_1-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-Al_Ahram-1">[1]</a></sup> When addressing the issue of women being mistreated by their husbands, she states, &quot;guardianship over women … does not give male members of the family license to oppress their female counterparts. Islam enjoins men to protect, love and care for their women folk.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Al_Ahram_1-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-Al_Ahram-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another scholar has noted that Islam abolished the horrible practice of female infanticide prevalent among the pagan Arabs. <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> gave clear directions leading to the restriction of polygamy, restrained the unlimited rights by men over their wives, and gave woman both spiritual and material equality with man.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>A recent Gallup survey polled a significant percentage of <a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics.html" title="Muslim Statistics">Muslims worldwide</a>. The findings are highlighted in the book <i>Who Speaks for Islam</i>, edited by John Esposito and Dalia Mogahed. The findings of the poll paint a picture of women in Islam that is in stark contrast to the oppression many in the West believe exists. For example, the authors note, &quot;Majorities of women in virtually every country we surveyed say that women deserve the same legal rights as men, to vote without influence from family members, to work at any job they are qualified for, and even to serve in the highest levels of government.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Concerning the ability of Muslim women to obtain an education, the poll demonstrated that Muslim women were often able to pursue post-secondary educations, particularly in Iran (52%), Egypt (34%), Saudi Arabia (32%), and Lebanon (37%).
</p><p>Pro-Islamic websites love to proclaim how Islam elevates the status of women. For example, at the website of the Muslim Student Association at the University of Southern California, one can find the following regarding <a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam.html" title="Women in Islam" class="mw-redirect">Women in Islam</a>:
</p>
<ul><li> Islam declared women and men equal.</li>
<li> Islam condemned pre-Islamic practices degrading and oppressing women.</li>
<li> The same injunctions and prohibitions of Islam equally apply to both sexes.</li>
<li> Islam gave woman the right of inheritance and the right of individual independent ownership unhampered by father, husband, brother, son or anyone else.</li>
<li> Islam gave women the right to accept or reject a marriage proposal free from pressure, and by mutual agreement to specify in the marriage contract that she has the right to divorce (if she misses that option she has the right to seek court divorce if she deems the marriage to have failed beyond repair).</li>
<li> Islam does not require woman to change her name at marriage.</li>
<li> Islam protects the family and condemns the betrayal of marital fidelity. It recognizes only one type of family: husband and wife united by authentic marriage contract.</li>
<li> &quot;Heaven is at the feet of mothers&quot;, is a basic Islamic teaching.</li>
<li> &quot;The best of you are the kindest to their wives and I am your best to mine&quot;, is a teaching by prophet Mohammad.</li>
<li> Islam enjoins sounds morality in thinking, behavior and appearance. Dress fashions and social patterns that reduce woman to a sex object and exploit her as such are not acceptable to Islam.</li>
<li> The observance of chastity and moral standards is equally demanded by Islam from both men and women. &quot;Women are the siblings of men&quot;, is a saying of prophet Mohammad.</li></ul>
<p>However, as with any area of study within Islam, one must separate out the current reality from the ideological underpinnings. If women are treated equally in Islam, is there justification for it in the sacred writings of Islam, or is this 'equal treatment' in conflict with sacred directives? What does the Qur'an say about women? What does Muhammad say about women as recorded in the hadith, and what kind of example did he set in the way he treated the women in his life? Do the reports we hear of women being oppressed accord with sacred scripture, or are they rather anomalies having no foundation in Islam? What have women from an Islamic background actually experienced – what are their stories? These are some of the issues we will be addressing.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Does_Islam_protect_women.3F">Does Islam protect women?</span></h2>
<p>A couple of verses of the Qur'an would seem to suggest that Islam holds a high view of women.
</p>
<div class="quotes">O ye who believe! <b>Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness</b>…except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary <b>live with them on a footing of kindness and equity</b>. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.019#004.019">4:19</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>Lodge them where you lodge according to your means, and do not injure them</b> in order that you may straiten them…<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/065-qmt.php#065.006#065.006">65:6</a></div></div>
<p>So at least on the surface, Islam suggests women are to be treated as equals with men and be provided for economically by their husbands. But what does the rest of the <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> say, and what can we learn about women from the traditions?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Husband_can_beat_a_wife_he_suspects_of_disobedience">Husband can beat a wife he suspects of disobedience</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. <b>As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them</b> (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.034#004.034">4:34</a></div></div>
<p><a href="wiki/Category-Islamic_Apologists.html" title="Category:Islamic Apologists">Muslim apologists</a> will assert that the term &quot;<a href="wiki/Wife_Beating_in_Islam.html" title="Wife Beating in Islam">and beat them</a>&quot; speaks only metaphorically. Others insist it means only a simple strike, as with hitting them with a feather or toothpick. Yusuf Ali adds the word 'lightly,' which never appears in the Arabic. Yet, a simple observation of the text shows any of the above to be erroneous. 
</p><p>The text presents a series of progressive disciplinary measures if a man suspects disobedience from his wife: 
</p>
<ol><li>Admonish her. Give her a verbal warning regarding her behavior. </li>
<li>sleep in separate beds from her. This humiliates the woman, for in Islam a woman's worth is measured, in part, by her ability to reproduce offspring, particularly male offspring. Sleeping in a separate bed from the wife dishonors her by limiting her ability to reproduce a male child.  </li>
<li>Beat them. This is the third, most significant step of the progressive discipline process and is expected to be the one that produces the desired result if the first two failed. </li></ol>
<p>So the idea of hitting the woman &quot;lightly&quot; with a toothpick as the most severe disciplinary measure loses the argument based simply on the text alone.
</p><p>In the most authoritative biography of Muhammad, written by ibn Ishaq, we find the following words of the prophet of Islam: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">You have rights over your wives and they have rights over you. You have the right that they should not defile your bed and that they should not behave with open unseemliness. If they do, <b>God allows you to put them in separate rooms and to beat them</b> but not with severity. If they refrain from these things they have the right to their food and clothing with kindness.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>Ibn Kathir records a hadith that states:
</p>
<div class="quotes">&quot;The best woman is she who when you look at her she <b>obeys you</b>, and when you are absent, she protects her honor and your property.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>Ibn Kathir further elaborates what constitutes ill conduct: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">[It is] the woman from whom you see ill conduct with her husband,<b> such as when she acts as if she is above her husband, disobeys him, ignores him, dislikes him, and so forth</b>. When these signs appear in a woman, her husband should advise her and remind her of Allah's torment if she disobeys him. Indeed, <b>Allah ordered the wife to obey her husband</b> and prohibited her from disobeying him, because of the <i>enormity of his rights</i> and all that he does for her.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p>Saudi feminist Wajeha Al-Huwaider describes the lives of many Arab women as similar to a prisoner. However, the Arab woman is a prisoner in her own home, has committed no crime, was not captured in battle, does not belong to any terrorist group.
</p><p>In the book <i>The Ideal Muslimah</i>, Dr. Muhammad Ali Al-Hashimi notes:
</p>
<div class="quotes">The true Muslim woman devotes herself to taking care of her house and husband. She knows her husband's rights over her, and how great they are, as was confirmed by the Prophet's words:
<p>&quot;No human being is permitted to prostrate to another, but if this were permitted I would have ordered wives to prostrate to their husbands, because of the greatness of the rights they have over them.&quot;
</p><p>A woman came to ask the Prophet (PBUH) about some matter, and when he had dealt with it, he asked her, &quot;Do you have a husband?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He asked her, &quot;How are you with him?&quot; She said, &quot;I never fall short in my duties, except for that which is beyond me.&quot; He said, &quot;Pay attention to how you treat him, for he is your Paradise and your Hell.&quot;
</p><p>How can the Muslim woman complain about taking care of her house and husband when she hears these words of Prophetic guidance? She should fulfil her household duties and take care of her husband in a spirit of joy, because she is not carrying a tiresome burden, she is doing work in her home that she knows will bring reward from Allah.
</p><p>One of the most important ways in which the Muslim woman obeys her husband is by respecting his wishes with regard to the permissible pleasures of daily life, such as social visits, food, dress, speech, etc. The more she responds to his wishes in such matters, the happier and more enjoyable the couple's life becomes, and the closer it is to the spirit and teachings of Islam.
</p><p>&quot;It is not permitted for a woman who believes in Allah (SWT) to allow anyone into her husband's house whom he dislikes; or to go out when he does not want her to; or to obey anyone else against him; or to forsake his bed; or to hit him. If he is wrong, then let her come to him until he is pleased with her, and if he accepts her then all is well, Allah (SWT) will accept her deeds and make her position stronger, and there will be no sin on her.&quot;
</p><p>It is a great honour for a woman to take care of her husband every morning and evening, and wherever he goes, treating him with gentleness and good manners which will fill his life with joy, tranquility and stability.
</p>
`Aisha urged women to take good care of their husbands and to recognize the rights that their husbands had over them. She saw these rights as being so great and so important that a woman was barely qualified to wipe the dust from her husband's feet with her face, as she stated: &quot;O womenfolk, if you knew the rights that your husbands have over you, every one of you would wipe the dust from her husband's feet with her face.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><br> </div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mut.27ah_marriages">Mut'ah marriages</span></h3>
<p>Mut'ah is a temporary arrangement whereby a man and a woman enter into a contractual arrangement to marry each other for a specified period of time. The time can be as little as one hour or as long as several years, though most Mutah contracts are for hours or a few days. The man gives the woman something of value, and in exchange he is allowed to enter into sexual relations with her, legally, without committing fornication, since they are &quot;married.&quot; At the end of the period specified in the contract, each party walks separate ways and neither is indebted to the other. For all intents and purposes, Mutah is nothing more than religiously endorsed prostitution.
</p><p>Mutah is practiced mainly by Shi'ites today, although at one time Muhammad permitted it for all Muslims. This is one of many areas of disagreement between Sunnis and Shi'ites: Sunnis believe Muhammad abrogated Mutah, while Shi'ites disagree and still practice Mutah as allowed by Muhammad.
</p><p><br>
The following quotations regarding Mut'ah marriages are from a Shi'ite Muslim website.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> 
</p>
<dl><dd>Whenever man sets foot on the earth the need to travel always emerges. Sometimes traveling can involve man going thousands of miles away from home, sometimes for moths, even years. Do one's sexual desires just evaporate when an individual is traveling? Sexual desire isn't like some light switch that turns off when a man leaves his wife to set off on his travels, and turns back home when he gets back! Sexual desire is something that remains permanently with a human, when it accompanies him at all times then how can he curtail such sexual feelings? When someone is traveling and accessing his wife is impossible, and he is incapable of summing her to join him, then what will a young red-blooded male do? Miles away from home, feeling sexually aroused his situation is not one wherein he can get permanently married, so what is he to do? He will feel the only way that he can relieve himself is by amalgamating himself into the society around him.  Islam does not permit a person to sexually relieve himself through masturbation nor is he permitted to adopt the ways of the kufr and indulge himself in fornication, it offers him a legitimate mechanism with which to relieve himself and that is temporary marriage.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>It is not just traveling, that might necessitate Mutah, there are many in society who just does not have the financial ability / standing to get permanent married, yet they still have sexual desires, again Mutah is there to ensure that they practice sex within the boundaries set by Allah (swt). </dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Islam is a religion that is suited for all nations and ages. Mut'ah is a good example of that. It is only the Deen of Islam that caters for sexual desire by permitting a legitimate method of control. For others societies the only mechanism that they see as the solution to relieving sexual feelings is through the practice of fornication. In the western world adultery and fornication are common and openly performed. Mut'ah is a way of protecting a person from committing these serious sins and vices.</dd></dl>

<div class="quotes">Marriage in Islam is intended to protect the chastity of men and women alike, therefore it is the woman's duty to respond to her husband's requests for conjugal relations. She should not give silly excuses and try to avoid it. For this reason, several hadith urge a wife to respond to her husband's needs as much as she is able, no matter how busy she may be or whatever obstacles there may be, so long as there is no urgent or unavoidable reason not to do so.
The issue of protecting a man's chastity and keeping him away from temptation is more important than anything else that a woman can do, because Islam wants men and women alike to live in an environment which is entirely pure and free from any motive of fitnah or haram pleasures. The flames of sexual desire and thoughts of pursuing them through haram means can only be extinguished by means of discharging that natural energy in natural and lawful ways.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.msawest.net/islam/humanrelations/womeninislam/idealmuslimah/chapter4.html">The ideal Muslimah - Chapter 4</a></div></div>

It was reported that the girl begged for mercy before being buried waist high in the ground and pummeled to death by a mob of 1,000.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

<a href="wiki/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law" class="mw-redirect">Islamic law</a> restricts the validity of a woman's testimony, particularly in cases involving sexual immorality. And Islamic legal theorists have limited it even farther, in the words of one Muslim legal manual, to &quot;cases involving property, or transactions dealing with property, such as sales.&quot; In other judicial areas only men can testify. It is virtually impossible, therefore, to prove rape in lands that follow these <i>Sharia </i>provisions. If the required male witnesses can't be found to exonerate her (four men who testify to seeing the actual crime, according to the Qur'an), the victim's charge of <a href="wiki/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> can become an admission of adultery. That accounts for the grim fact that as many as seventy-five percent of the women in prison in Pakistan are, in fact, behind bars for the crime of having been raped.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

<p>In the Muslim holy city of Mecca in March 2002, fifteen teenage girls perished in a fire at their school when the Saudi religious police, the muttawa, wouldn't let them out of the building. Why? Because in the female-only school environment, they had shed the all-concealing outer garments that Saudi women must wear in the presence of men. They had not put these garments back on before trying to flee from the fire. The muttawa preferred that they die rather than transgress Islamic law, and actually battled police and firemen who were trying to open the school's doors and to save the girls. <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Honor_killings_by_family_members">Honor killings by family members</span></h3>
<p>Domestic violence is an issue that transcends cultures and is not limited solely to the Islamic world. This is the argument generally made by Muslim sympathizers to deflect focus on the Islamic practice of honor killing. While honor killing indeed occurs in other cultures, Islam is the only culture and religion where honor killing is sanctioned by religious tenets. Shari'a law allows a father or mother to murder family members without penalty: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Retaliation is obligatory .... against anyone who kills a human being purely intentionally and without right ... The following are not subject to retaliation ... (4) a father or mother (or their fathers or mothers) for killing their offspring.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">'Umdat al-Salik (Reliance of the Traveller), section o1.1-2</div></div> 
<p>In other words, according to the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence, a father or mother may murder their offspring for any reason, without fear of penalty or punishment. Most often, this sort of religiously sanctioned murder is done to preserve family &quot;honor&quot; and usually the female gender takes the brunt of this sort of barbaric discipline.
</p><p>The United Nations Population Fund estimated in September 2000 that as many as 5,000 women and girls fall victim to such killings each year. Here are but a few that have captured media attention recently.

Their crime: wanting to be like other teenagers in high school and dress in western clothing. Yaser was assisted by his wife and has fled the country. A reward for his arrest is still active, though speculation suggests Said is back in Egypt and in full protection there.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Female_circumcision_.28FGM.29">Female circumcision (FGM)</span></h3>
<p>In some Islamic countries women face the certainty of female circumcision, otherwise known as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Somali women's rights activist and ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali notes that in her own homeland virtually every girl has her clitoris excised, sometimes when as young as five years old, and that the practice is always justified in the name of Islam. 
</p><p>Uncircumcised girls are told they will become prostitutes but that circumcised girls will be pure and will retain their honor and dignity. Ayaan Hirsi Ali describes her own genital mutilation in her book <i>Infidel</i>: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Grandma caught hold of me and gripped my upper body… Two other women held my legs apart. The man, who was probably an itinerant traditional circumciser from the blacksmith clan, picked up a pair of scissors. With the other hand, he caught hold of the place between my legs and started tweaking it, like Grandma milking a goat... Then the scissors went down between my legs and the man cut off my inner labia and clitoris. I heard it, like a butcher snipping the fat off a piece of meat. A piercing pain shot up between my legs, indescribable, and I howled. Then came the sewing: the long, blunt needle clumsily pushed into my bleeding outer labia, my loud and anguished protests, Grandma's words of comfort and encouragement… When the sewing was finished, the man cut the thread off with his teeth. That is all I can recall of it.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p>Among Muslims FGM is prevalent mainly in Egypt, Sudan, and Somalia, and in other African countries. Muslims who practice it invest genital mutilation with religious significance. One Islamic legal manual states that circumcision is required &quot;for both men and women.&quot;
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Reliance_of_the_Traveller">Reliance of the Traveller</span></h4>
<p>This manual of Islamic law prescribes female circumcision, but with an interesting twist. In English versions, the law forbids removal of the female clitoris, while in the original Arabic no such restriction exists.
</p><p>English translation: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">e4.3 Circumcision is obligatory (O: for both men and women. For men is consists of removing the prepuce from the penis, and for women, removing the prepuce (Ar. bazr) of the clitoris (n: not the clitoris itself, as some mistakenly assert).<br> </div>
<p>Original Arabic: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Circumcision is obligatory (for every male and female) by cutting off the piece of skin on the glans of the penis of the male, but <b>circumcision of the female is by cutting out the clitoris</b> (this is called khufaad).<br> </div>
<p>To Sheikh Muhammad Sayyed Tantawi, the Grand Imam of Cairo's al-Azhar, the oldest and most prestigious university in the lands of Islam, female circumcision is &quot;a laudable practice that does honor to women.&quot; Tantawi is no fringe figure: he is, in the words of a BBC report, &quot;the highest spiritual authority for nearly a billion Sunni Muslims.&quot; 
</p><p>In endorsing female circumcision he uses this considerable spiritual authority to perpetuate a practice that gives women lifelong pain and blocks their access to sexual fulfillment. But perhaps in the eyes of Sheikh Tantawi the pain is worth the result: most authorities agree that female circumcision is designed to diminish a woman's sexual response, so that she will be less likely to commit adultery.

<p>Parvin Darabi recounts the last moments of her sister's life. Homa Darabi committed suicide rather than continue to live the repressive life of a woman in post-1979 Iran. <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd>During her professional life my sister was under pressure from some parents of her younger patients to give the label of &quot;mentally incapacitated&quot; to many perfectly intelligent young girls so that they could be saved from the tortures of the zealots (150 strokes of a whip for things such as wearing makeup or lipstick). Having to label these young women truly broke my sister's heart. When a sixteen-year-old girl was shot to death in northern Tehran for wearing lipstick, my sister could no longer handle the guilt she felt about her former involvement in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. She finally decided to protest the oppression of women by setting herself on fire in a crowded square in northern Tehran on February 21, 1994. Her last cries were, 'Death to tyranny! Long live liberty! Long live Iran.'</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Each time my family members visited a girl as a potential wife for my uncle or cousins, their evaluation of the poor young girl would make me sick. It was as if they were buying a piece of furniture. The only thing important was her physical features.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The way the Muslims in my family and neighborhood acted, it was clear that a woman's treasure was her virginity before marriage and her vagina after marriage.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In 1991, the Prosecutor-General of Iran declared that &quot;anyone who rejects the principle of <i>hijab</i> is an apostate and the punishment for an apostate under Islamic law is death.&quot; Girls condemned to death may not undergo the sentence as long as they are virgin. Thus they are systematically raped before the sentence is executed.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The only thing the Islamic Republic has brought to the Iranian people is poverty and misery. At the time of the revolution Khomeini told people that God was on their side. If this is what we will get by having God on our side, I am so pleased to not have Khomeini's so-called &quot;God&quot; on mine.</dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Yagmur_Darsun">Yagmur Darsun</span></h3>
<dl><dd>I was born in rural Turkey. Generally, Turkish women enjoy many freedoms that our Arab sisters can't even think of. Rural Turkey is a different story. Honor killings take place every day, women don't have much say (if any) in household matters, and female employment is out of the question. However, much hard work is done by women because men don't want to strain themselves. If a husband tells you to do something, you have to obey.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I was a disciplined and obedient girl, unlike my sister who was somewhat uppity. When she was eighteen, she fell in love with a young man. They both loved each other, but he was meant for another girl, thus his parents had decided. Dating is utterly forbidden in Islam; marriages are arranged and often young people meet on their wedding day.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>My sister was rebellious. She &quot;dated&quot; that young man. Every night she would go to see him. They even kissed and then their relationship went too far: she got pregnant.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I remember their young faces. I could see they were happy. Their happiness made me happy, too, and I wanted to smile.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Instead of eloping, they decided to speak to my father. Pregnancy is a very good reason to get permission for marriage, or so they thought.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Alas, my sister had miscalculated my father's love for her and his obsession with his religion. He became furious. Instead of letting the two young lovers marry and build their nest of love, he took her to the religious elders and they ruled that she had committed adultery. She was sentenced to death by stoning. They showed no mercy even for her unborn child. She had stained the &quot;honor&quot; of the family and the only to remove that stain was to nip her life in the bud. Her unborn baby was a stain, too, and that little creature had to be destroyed as well so my family could live honorably.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I still remember her black eyes; she stared into the sky while she was dug into the ground. She was wrapped in white sheets and her hands were tied to her body. She was buried up to her waist. The rabid mob circled her with stones in their hands and started throwing them at her while the roars of <i>Allah-u-Akbar!, Allah-u-Akbar!</i> added to their frenzy. She twitched with pain as the stones hit her tender body and smashed her head. Blood gushed out from her face, cheeks, mouth, nose, and eyes. All she could do was to bend to the left and to the right. Gradually the movements slowed down and finally she stopped moving even thought the shower of the stones did not stop. Her head fell to her chest. Her bloodied face remained serene. All the pain had gone. The hysterical mob relented and the chant of <i>Allah-u-Akbar</i> stopped. Her bright black eyes that beamed with life were shut. Her jovial laughter that filled the world around her was silenced. Her heart that beat with such a heavenly love for only a short time had stopped. Her unborn baby was not given a chance to breathe one breath of air.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The saddest part is that, according to Islam, my sister deserved that death. The elders were sure she would be burning in hell for eternity.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I do hate Islam. Islam preserved the worst in our culture, reducing women into slavery and keeping them ignorant. When I look at my daughters, I pray that they may live in a free world, free from Islam and this slavery.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_in_Islam_-_From_Islam's_Sources.html#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></dd></dl>
