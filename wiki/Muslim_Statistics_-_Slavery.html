<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical">Historical</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">A comparison of the Islamic slave trade to the American slave trade reveals some interesting contrasts.  <b>While two out of every three slaves shipped across the Atlantic were men, the proportions were reversed in the Islamic slave trade.  Two women for every man were enslaved by the Muslims</b>.
<p><b>While the mortality rate for slaves being transported across the Atlantic was as high as 10%, the percentage of slaves dying in transit in the Trans Sahara and East African slave trade was between 80 and 90%</b>!
</p><p>While almost all the slaves shipped across the Atlantic were for agricultural work, most of the slaves destined for the Muslim Middle East were for sexual exploitation as concubines, in harems, and for military service.  
</p><p>While many children were born to slaves in the Americas, and millions of their descendants are citizens in Brazil and the USA to this day, very few descendants of the slaves that ended up in the Middle East survive.  
</p><p>While most slaves who went to the Americas could marry and have families, most of the male slaves destined for the Middle East were castrated, and most of the children born to the women were killed at birth.
</p><p>It is estimated that possibly as many as 11 million Africans were transported across the Atlantic (95% of which went to South and Central America, mainly to Portuguese, Spanish and French possessions.  Only 5% of the slaves went to the United States). 
</p><p><b>However, at least 28 million Africans were enslaved in the Muslim Middle East.  As at least 80% of those captured by Muslim slave traders were calculated to have died before reaching the slave markets, it is believed that the death toll from the 14 centuries of Muslim slave raids into Africa could have been over 112 million.  When added to the number of those sold in the slave markets, the total number of African victims of the Trans Saharan and East African slave trade could be significantly higher than 140 million people</b>.<br>. . .<br>
<b>Historian Robert Davis in his book &quot;Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters - White Slavery In the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy&quot;, estimates that North African Muslim pirates abducted and enslaved more than 1 million Europeans between 1530 and 1780</b>.  These white Christians were seized in a series of raids which depopulated coastal towns from Sicily to Cornwall.  <b>Thousands of white Christians in coastal areas were seized every year to work as galley slaves, labourers and concubines for Muslim slave masters</b> in what is today Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya.  Villages and towns on the coast of Italy, Spain, Portugal and France were the hardest hit, but the Muslim slave raiders also seized people as far afield as Britain, Ireland and Iceland.  They even captured 130 American seamen from ships they boarded in the Atlantic between 1785 and 1793.  
</p><p>According to one report, <b>7000 English people were abducted between 1622 to 1644</b>, many of them ship crews and passengers.  But the Corsairs also landed on unguarded beaches, often at night, to snatch the unwary.  Almost all the inhabitants of the village of Baltimore, in Ireland, were captured in 1631, and there were other raids in Devon and Cornwall.  Many of these white, Christian slaves were put to work in quarries, building sites and galleys and endured malnutrition, disease and mistreatment at the hands of their Muslim slave masters.  Many of them were used for public works such as building harbours. 
</p>
Female captives were sexually abused in palace harems and others were held as hostages and bargained for ransom.  &quot;The most unlucky ended up stuck and forgotten out in the desert, in some sleepy town such as Suez, or in Turkish Sultanate galleys, where some slaves rowed for decades without ever setting foot on shore.&quot; Professor Davis estimates that <b>up to 1,25 million Europeans were enslaved by Muslim slave raiders between 1500 to 1800</b>. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Slavery.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes">[The Mediterranean slavery of the 16th and 17th centuries] was not race slavery, but nor was it indiscriminate.  <b>It was <i>religious</i> slavery</b>.  The human beings kidnapped and sold by the Barbary pirates were fair game because they were Christian. A Christian slave on the Barbary Coast could attain his freedom by converting to Islam, and many did so.<br>. . .<br>
One of the most impressive parts of Prof. Davis’s book is his computation of the numbers of Europeans enslaved by these Muslim raiders.  Combing through the historical sources, he concludes that there were about 35,000 enslaved Christians on the Barbary Coast at any one time.  He then sets about estimating attrition rates.  Slave numbers declined through four causes:  death, escape, redemption (i.e. by ransom), and conversion to Islam.  Davis gets annual rates from these causes of 17 percent, 1 percent, 2-3 percent, and 4 percent, respectively.  This implies a total number of slaves, from the early 1500s to the late 1700s, of one to one and a quarter million.  This is an astonishing number, implying that <b>well into the 17th century, the Mediterranean slave trade was out-producing the Atlantic one</b>.  Numbers fell off thereafter, while the transatlantic trade increased; but in its time, <b>the enslavement of European Christians by Muslim North Africans was the main kind of enslavement going on in the world</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Slavery.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes">The result, then, is that between 1530 and 1780 there were almost certainly a million and quite possibly as many as a million and a quarter white, European Christians enslaved by the Muslims of the Barbary Coast.<br>. . .<br>
In fact, even a tentative slave count in Barbary inevitably begs a host of new questions. To begin with, the estimates arrived at here make it clear that for most of the first two centuries of the modern era, <b>nearly as many Europeans were taken forcibly to Barbary and worked or sold as slaves as were West Africans hauled off to labor on plantations in the Americas. In the sixteenth century especially, during which time the Atlantic slave runners still averaged only around 3,200 Africans annually, the corsairs of Algiers – and later Tunis and Tripoli – were regularly snatching that many or more white captives on a single raiding voyage</b> to Sicily, the Balearics, or Valencia.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Slavery.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><br> </div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pakistan">Pakistan</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Officials at the U.S. embassy in Islamabad say at least three landlords have held as many as 170 bonded farmworkers at gunpoint on their estates in the country's southeast Sindh province since late September.<br>. . .<br>
<p>The crisis began after the workers' advocates successfully petitioned three district courts to declare as illegal the debts that the landlords were using to compel the workers into indentured servitude. Those debts average around 1,000 Pakistani rupees — roughly $12. The hostages, a third of whom are children, some as young as 4 months old, are landless peasants, known as haari in Urdu. According to Ghulam Hyder, a spokesman for Pakistan's Green Rural Development Organization, the landlords have killed one hostage already and are threatening to kill the others unless they drop the cases and return to work.<br>. . .<br>
A 2004 study by the International Labour Office (ILO) estimated that <b>there are up to a million haari families in Sindh alone, the majority living in conditions of debt bondage, which the U.N. defines as modern-day slavery</b>. Last fall, Pakistan's Daily Times newspaper quoted the labor minister of neighboring Punjab province as saying that landlords hold millions of forced laborers in &quot;private prisons&quot; across the country.
</p>
While the nation's 1992 Bonded Labour System Act mandates five-year sentences for violators, <b>Pakistani officials have yet to record a single conviction</b>. &quot;The police are turning a blind eye on the issue,&quot; says Hyder<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Slavery.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">October 2009</div></div>

<div class="quotes">&quot;The classification of the conflict as a &quot;holy war&quot; -- a jihad against the Christian South and its allies in the Nuba Mountains - legitimized in the eyes of many Northern Muslims the revival of the centuries-old practice of taking slaves as war booty.&quot;
<p>In slave raids on Southern villages, conducted by government-backed Arab militias known as murahaleen, estimated <b>hundreds of thousands of blacks, mostly women and children, were captured, transported to the North and enslaved</b>.
</p><p>Since 1995, AASG's partner, Christian Solidarity International (CSI), has been working to free Sudan's slaves.

</p><p>In 2005, under guidance of the US Government, the North and the South signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that ended the war and provided for Southern self-determination. The CPA ended the slave raids, but left the fate of those already in bondage unresolved. According to the recent Congressional testimony of CSI's CEO Dr. John Eibner, <b>approximately 35,000 are still serving their masters in parts of Southern Darfur and Kordofan</b>.

<div class="quotes"><b>Officially, slavery was abolished back in 1962</b> but a judge's decision to pass on the title deed of a &quot;slave&quot; from one master to another has blown the lid off the hidden bondage of hundreds of Yemenis.
<p>The judge in <b>the town of Hajja, which is home to some 300 slaves</b>, according to residents, said he had certified the transfer only because the new owner planned to free the slave.

</p><p>A 2009 report by the human rights ministry found that males and females were still enslaved in the provinces of Hudaydah and Hajja, in northwest Yemen -- the Arab world's most impoverished country.<br>. . .<br>
&quot;We are still in the process of trying to count the numbers of slaves,&quot; the coordinator of rights group Hood, Mohammed Naji Allaw, told AFP, explaining that slaves were &quot;owned by title deeds, or inherited within families.&quot;

</p><p>In addition to &quot;slaves whose owner can use them however he wants,&quot; the ministry report also refers to other groups subjected to slave-like conditions, although they are not bound by documents.
