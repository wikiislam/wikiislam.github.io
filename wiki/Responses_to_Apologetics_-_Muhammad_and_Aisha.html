<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_did_not_have_sexual_intercourse_with_Aisha_when_she_was_6_years-old">Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Aisha when she was 6 years-old</span></h4>
<p>This is a strawman argument. No one of any note has claimed Muhammad had sexual intercourse with Aisha when she was 6 years-old. It was only their marriage that took place when she was aged 6. Sexual intercourse occurred when she was 9 <a href="wiki/Islamic_Lunar_Calendar.html" title="Islamic Lunar Calendar">lunar</a> years-old (possibly 8 years-old if the Gregorian calender is used to calculate her age).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Qur.27an_does_not_say_Muhammad_married_Aisha_when_she_was_6_and_had_sex_with_her_when_she_was_9">The Qur'an does not say Muhammad married Aisha when she was 6 and had sex with her when she was 9</span></h4>

<p>There is no purpose of an Islamic marriage (<a href="wiki/Nikah.html" title="Nikah" class="mw-redirect">nikah</a>) if there will be no sex between the couple. If 54 year old Muhammad did not want to have sex with 9 year old Aisha but wanted to keep her in his house, he could easily have adopted her as his grand-daughter instead. He already had an adopted son.
</p><p>And even if we were to accept the marriage as a result of Allah's foreknowledge, it still does not explain why he could not foretell that millions of young girls today would face <a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html" title="Contemporary Pedophilic Islamic Marriages">pedophilic child marriages</a>, explicitly using Muhammad and Aisha's relationship as justification.<sup id="cite_ref-University_of_Houston_4-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-University_of_Houston-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sheikh_Hamoud_5-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Sheikh_Hamoud-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mufti_Fazlul_6-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Mufti_Fazlul-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Imam_Sani_7-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Imam_Sani-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sheikh_Mohamed_Ben_8-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Sheikh_Mohamed_Ben-8">[8]</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_hadiths_do_not_say_Muhammad_had_sex_with_Aisha_when_she_was_9._They_have_been_poorly_translated">The hadiths do not say Muhammad had sex with Aisha when she was 9. They have been poorly translated</span></h4>
<p>In multiple sahih hadiths, as discussed in <a href="wiki/The_Meaning_of_Consummate.html" title="The Meaning of Consummate">this article</a>, the Arabic terms used are &quot;udkhilath&quot; and &quot;bana biha&quot;, which in their context can only be referring to &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and nothing else.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="There_is_1_hadith_that_says_Aisha_.22never_saw_the_private_parts_of_Muhammad.22">There is 1 hadith that says Aisha &quot;never saw the private parts of Muhammad&quot;</span></h4>
<p>The hadith being referred to is found in Sunan Ibn Majah. This collection of hadith (containing Arabic text alongside its English translation) can be purchased in book form or freely viewed on the Internet, and has a unique and useful feature that separates it from other hadith collections. Each narration &quot;is also followed by its status in regards to the authenticity.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The hadith concerning Aisha &quot;never seeing the private parts of Muhammad&quot; has been classed as da'if,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> meaning it is weak. And weak hadiths hold no authority in Islam and have no value for the purpose of formulating shari'ah.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Since those who use this hadith for apologetic purposes will be aware of its status as weak,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> the omission of this crucial detail may be considered by some as disingenuous.
</p><p>Additionally, the hadiths that confirm Aisha consummated her marriage are mutawatir ('corroborated'), meaning the same narrations (either with minor variation or word-for-word) have been passed down through different isnads (chains). 
</p><p>When the same/similar narration is passed down through <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Aisha.html#Aisha.27s_Age_at_Consummation_and_Marriage" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Aisha">multiple isnads</a>, then it is of higher authenticity than one which may be reported through a lesser number of isnads (especially if they contradict). This classification can be joined with other classifications; for example, if a narration were both 'sahih' and 'mutawatir' then it is of the highest authenticity regarding classification of ahadith. 
</p><p>Since all the most authentic collections confirm that the relationship between Muhammad and Aisha was a sexual one, this lone, weak hadith can be ignored. 
</p><p>The idea that Aisha was a virgin her entire life is an alien one to Islam, and if we were to be as &quot;difficult&quot; and/or disingenuous as the apologists appear to be, we could always point out that, literally speaking, there is no need to &quot;see the private parts&quot; of anyone in order to have sex with them.
</p><p>There are also hadith which tell us Muhammad had sex with all (9 to 11) of his wives in one night,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and Sauda (who was fat)<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> gave up her night of sex to Aisha.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Are we now to believe he was in fact not having sex with them, but reading them bedtime stories or engaging in some other evening activity?
</p><p>There are also sahih narations which tell us that Muhammad's first encounter with Aisha following her admittance into his house &quot;surprised&quot; her,<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> that she used to wash and scrape off the semen from his clothes,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> and that he used to fondle her and suck her tongue.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

These alternate ages have been derived from misquotations, indirect sources, fuzzy dating techniques, and slander, in an attempt to cast doubt upon facts which have been unquestionably accepted by Muslims for almost 1,500 years. 
</p><p>Even today, the vast majority of the world's Muslims acknowledge and accept Aisha's young age and many of these honest Muslims take offense to these lies propagated by western Muslim apologists who are embarrassed by their own prophet's actions. In fact, Islamic scholar and teacher of Fiqh at Sunnipath.com and Livingislam.org, Shaykh <a href="wiki/Gibril_Haddad.html" title="Gibril Haddad">Gibril Fouad Haddad's</a> work has been referenced in our refutation to all these claims, which you can <a href="wiki/Aishas_Age_of_Consummation.html" title="Aishas Age of Consummation">read here</a>.

<p>Playing with dolls and similar images is forbidden in Islam, unless you are a child who has yet to reach the age of puberty.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Thus, the <a href="wiki/Muhammad_and_the_Clinical_Definition_of_Pedophilia.html#Only_pre-pubescent_girls_were_allowed_to_play_with_dolls" title="Muhammad and the Clinical Definition of Pedophilia">doll-playing exegesis</a> applied to the relevant hadith narrations prove that Aisha remained pre-pubertal at the time of consummation.

<p>This is purely wishful thinking that ultimately backfires on the user because it assumes Muhammad, the perfect Muslim whose example is to be emulated, defied Allah by not adhering to his sacred law (the Shar'iah).

For example, the mean ages at menarche for Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom are 13.0, 13.2 and 13.3.

</p><p>For girls in the Medieval (5<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> century) Middle East, the average age at menarche was between 12 to 13 years of age, not 9. In fact, the average age at menarche for Medieval Europeans was very similar, at 12 to 14 years of age.<sup id="cite_ref-Mum.org_26-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Mum.org-26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>If we were to accept this interpretation made by apologists, it would mean Aisha is also making an incorrect blanket statement. Not many girls go through puberty at the age of 9, especially in the Middle East during Aisha's lifetime,<sup id="cite_ref-Mum.org_26-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Mum.org-26">[26]</a></sup> yet she appears to be claiming <i>all</i> 9 year-olds go through puberty. So the only conclusion that can be drawn from this erroneous interpretation is that this &quot;great scholar of Islam&quot; was stupid. 
</p><p>If we take a rational approach to reaching conclusions, we can clearly see this alleged narration does not prove Aisha had attained puberty. &quot;she has attained puberty&quot; is written in parenthesis, meaning it was added by the translator and was not taken from the original source. 
</p><p>She was also a young child who had been sexually defiled at the age of nine, so obviously she would consider that moment in time to have been the moment when she went from being a child to becoming a women. Her statement had absolutely nothing to do with attaining puberty.

<p>According to Bukhari, Aisha fell ill and lost her hair after her marriage/engagement to Muhammad at the age of six. The same hadith also confirms that she was &quot;handed over to him&quot; once her hair grew back.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Since Bukhari is Sahih (authentic), we have no reason to dismiss this explanation.
</p><p>Also according to Tabari (a less reliable, yet widely respected and accepted source among Muslims), the delay was due to Muhammad not having the gold to pay the sadaq.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>  
</p><p>One thing we can be sure of is that the delay had nothing to do with her pubertal status, as such an important issue would not have gone without some commentary by the early Islamic sources and it would have also contradicted Muhammad's Qur'anic revelation which <a href="wiki/Pedophilia_in_the_Qur'an.html" title="Pedophilia in the Qur'an">sanctions pedophilia</a>.

<p>It is not unusual for a pedophile to know his intended child partner for some years before initiating <i>sexual</i> contact. This is known as &quot;grooming&quot;. A survey by the Mayo Clinic revealed heterosexual male pedophiles preferred girls in the age range of 8-10 years (Aisha was 9), and frequently met them when they were even younger.<sup id="cite_ref-Mayo_Clinic_29-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Mayo_Clinic-29">[29]</a></sup>

<p>Aisha's parents did not offer her to Muhammad. It was in fact Muhammad who approached Abu Bakr, and he (Aisha's father) initially protested.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

<p>Abu Bakr was already Muhammad's closest companion. There was no need for him to &quot;cement relations&quot; with Abu Bakr by marrying his 6-year-old daughter, and thereby forever legitimizing child-marriages within Islam. 
</p><p>Additionally, if this was the sole purpose behind the marriage, he could have just as easily married Abu Bakr's other daughter, Asma bint Abu Bakr, who was a lot older and not married at the time.

It is an excuse that many pedophiles use to justify their behavior. 
</p><p>In fact, Aisha did <i>not</i> consent to her marriage. This is the specific reason why Islamic scholars are &quot;unanimously agreed that a father may marry off his young daughter without consulting her.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Furthermore, &quot;there is no age limit to be intimate with one's wife even if she is a minor (did not attain puberty)&quot;, but &quot;when she attains puberty, she has the right to maintain the marriage or discontinue the marriage.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

</p><p>Besides, a lot of other things were acceptable in the past, but that does not make them any more moral or right.
</p><p>Drinking <a href="wiki/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and gambling were both permitted activities in pre-Islamic Arabia, yet Muhammad chose to ban these relatively harmless &quot;cultural norms&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Why did he not do the same for <a href="wiki/Slavery.html" title="Slavery">slavery</a> or pedophilia rather than indulging in both himself?

<p>This is a false argument based on the conflation of two different things. <i>Life expectancy</i>, which refers to the average length of life from birth, lowered in the past by very high rates of infant mortality. And the <i>average lifespan</i>, which looks at how long people lived once they had passed the infant stage.
</p><p>So, when apologists claim,&quot;people lived shorter life spans,&quot; it does not mean people in the past lived an accelerated life cycle. It means that more of them died as children than do today.
</p><p>For example, if a society had a <i>life expectancy</i> of 35 years, this does not mean that a person of 35 years was considered to be old. If they managed to live past their childhood years, they still had a very good chance of continuing on to that society's <i>average lifespan</i>, which could have been 60 or 70 years of age. What it does mean, is that so many children died at birth, or at 5, or at 11 years of age that it brought the average <i>life expectancy</i> down.
</p><p>A nine year old girl in 7<sup>th</sup> century Arabia would absolutely not &quot;be comparable to a 20 year old today.&quot; She would still be just a nine year old girl.
</p><p>Additionally, Muhammad lived to the age of 63 years, Aisha to 66, Asma bint Abu Bakr to 100, Khadijah to 64 and Abu Bakr to 61. Do these seem like shorter lives?
</p><p>Even today in developed countries, someone who reaches the age of 60 is considered old, and rarely do people reach the age of 100. If you knew your daughter would die like Aisha at 66, would that make it okay for her to have sex at the age of 9 with a 54 year old man?

</p><p>In some cases, Muhammad and Aisha's relationship is used to effectively &quot;turn back the clock&quot; by legalizing child marriages in places they were previously illegal. For example; in 2010, the Malaysian State of southern Malacca legalized child marriages specifically between adult Muslim men and young Muslim girls <i>below</i> the age of 16. Ivy Josiah, the executive director of the <i>Women's Aid Organisation</i>, noted &quot;Child marriage amounts to paedophilia ... It is really a regressive move.

</p><p>The Islamic texts themselves specifically destroy any appeals to cultural relativism that could be otherwise aimed at Muhammad's marriage.

Bukhari and Muslim, on the other hand, are canonical Islamic writings of the utmost religious authenticity, accepted by approximately 90 percent of the world's Muslims.
</p><p>Even if we do accept this tu-quoque logical fallacy as a valid argument, there remains several problems. The first being the fact that the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia page does not say Mary married Joseph when she was aged only 12. 
</p><p>What it actually says, after warning readers once again that the stories are &quot;unreliable&quot;, is that Mary was 12 to 14 at the time of the choosing of candidates, and the Annunciation (the announcement by the angel Gabriel to the <i>virgin</i> called Mary, that she would conceive and become the mother of Jesus)<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> took place two years later.<sup id="cite_ref-Catholic_Encyclopedia_2_73-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Catholic_Encyclopedia_2-73">[73]</a></sup> This would make Mary 14 to 16 at the time of her marriage, not 12, or 9, as was the case between Muhammad and Aisha. She would have been a teenager of child-bearing age, not a pre-pubescent pre-teen child.
</p><p>Another problem is that the theological significance of Joseph and Muhammad to the Christian and Islamic faiths are incomparable (i.e. the logical fallacy of <a href="wiki/False_Equivalence.html" title="False Equivalence">false equivalence</a>). Unlike the Muslim view of Muhammad, Christians do not consider Joseph to be an uswa hasana (excellent model of conduct). Joseph's moral character holds no importance within Christian theology. He could have been insane and it would not matter to a Christian.
</p><p>Then there is the fact that, according to both the Christian scriptures and the Islamic ones, Mary was a virgin when she conceived and gave birth to Jesus; therefore, her relationship with Joseph could not have been a sexual one until after Jesus' birth, making her possibly 17 years of age at the time the marriage was eventually consummated, if ever. 
</p><p>Indeed, the same New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia page continues the narrative of Joseph's life by stating both Mary and Joseph entered the marriage with the understanding that it was never to be consummated.<sup id="cite_ref-Catholic_Encyclopedia_4_74-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-Catholic_Encyclopedia_4-74">[74]</a></sup>
</p><p>Mary's Perpetual virginity, the belief that Mary remained a virgin her entire life, is an essential article of faith for the majority of the worlds Christians (including the Roman Catholic, Anglo-Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christians). It is even held by some Muslims.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>
</p><p>Finally, the most decisive argument against the claim that Joseph was a pedophile is the fact that the same non-canonical writings which are used to gather information on Joseph and Mary's age, also confirm Mary's status as &quot;ever virgin&quot; (in The History of Joseph the Carpenter, Jesus says on Joseph's death &quot;my mother, virgin undefiled&quot;).<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Catholic_.26_Eastern_Churches_believe_pedophile_Joseph_is_a_Saint.2C_that.27s_the_same_as_an_Uswa_Hasana_in_Islam">Catholic &amp; Eastern Churches believe pedophile Joseph is a Saint, that's the same as an Uswa Hasana in Islam</span></h4>
<p>A saint and an uswa hasana are nothing alike. The entire Islamic faith, almost all of its laws, rituals, and moral principles, are defined by the uswa hasana's actions. A saint has no similar function in Christianity. Their actions do not determine Christian laws, rituals, or moral principles in any way. Joan of Arc and countless others are Catholic saints too, but that means very little to how one practices Christianity.
</p><p>Muhammad is the central figure of Islam, Joseph is not the central figure of Christianity. Islam would not exist if Muslims decided Muhammad was immoral. On the other hand, for Christians of any stripe, Joseph is a &quot;non entity&quot; as far as its theology is concerned. The closest analogy to Muhammad and an uswa hasana in Christianity is the figure of Jesus, and very few non-Christians would argue that their view of Christians and Christianity would not improve if his followers behaved more like him.
</p><p>In addition, it is the same Catholic and Eastern Churches which consider Joseph a saint, who also hold to the belief of Mary's perpetual virginity. Since Mary's ever-lasting virginity is an integral part or &quot;pillar&quot; of their faith, and most modern theologians think the Pope could reverse a sainthood without undermining the Church's doctrines,<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> it is not hard to imagine what would have become of Joseph's saint status if he did have intercourse with Mary. 
</p><p>Furthermore, as has already been stated in the previous section, Joseph cannot be labeled as a pedophile by anyone's standards because there is no authoritative, or even apocryphal, Christian text that state an adult Joseph had sex with a child Mary. Therefore, even if the status of saint was equivalent to that of an uswa hasana, it would not matter to a Christian or help Muslims in excusing the actions of Muhammad.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="If_Muhammad_was_a_pedophile.2C_then_so_is_the_Christian_god_for_impregnating_Mary">If Muhammad was a pedophile, then so is the Christian god for impregnating Mary</span></h4>
<p>Ignoring the fact that a pedophile by its very definition means someone who is sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children,<sup id="cite_ref-DSM-IV-TR_51-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-DSM-IV-TR-51">[51]</a></sup> so a teenager of child-bearing age is not pre-pubescent, it has already been shown in a <a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#Mary_married_90-year-old_Joseph_when_she_was_only_12.2C_so_Joseph_was_a_pedophile_too">previous section</a> that there is no authoritative Christian text which state Mary's age. Claims about her age are, at best, educated guesses, but guesses none-the-less. 
</p><p>Additionally, the apocryphal literature (the Christian equivalent of <a href="wiki/List_of_Fabricated_Hadith.html" title="List of Fabricated Hadith">weak or fabricated hadith</a>) used to gather information on Mary's possible age actually reveal she may have been 16 at the time of her marriage, not 12. 
</p><p>Even if we were to assume she was 12 at the time, there still remain several problems with this claim.
</p><p>According to the Bible, Mary became with child by &quot;the power of the Highest&quot;,<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> a phrase that does not, or does not necessarily, correspond to Mary being &quot;impregnated.&quot;
</p><p>Even if we do accept that the Christian god &quot;impregnated&quot; Mary, both Christians and Muslims believe God is omnipotent. Therefore sexual intercourse, something which would have to take place if we were to accept this claim, is not necessary in order to achieve this. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination" class="extiw" title="w:Artificial insemination">artificial insemination</a> needs no sexual intercourse. If humans can create a method to impregnate people without the need for sexual intercourse, why can an omnipotent deity not do the same? Of course, from an omnipotent entity, this would not need to be a physical procedure, nor would there be a need for the hymen to be torn.
</p><p>Muslims also believe in the virgin birth. So, if Muslims insist the Christian god must have had sex with Mary in order to have a son, it is tantamount to an admission that, according to Islam, Allah must have also had sex with Mary in order for her to conceive Jesus.
</p><p>In short; the Christian text do not mention anything of a sexual nature, i.e. there was no penis or any other indicator suggesting a sexual experience. Clearly, if there was no physical contact involved, then there was no sexual contact. Without this much needed sexual contact, there is no pedophilia. 
</p><p>Conversely, the Qur'an explicitly tells us Allah (or Gabriel if we refer to the tafsir text) <a href="wiki/Allah_and_Marys_Vagina.html" title="Allah and Marys Vagina">blew into Mary's vagina</a> in order for her to conceive Jesus.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Americans_and_Europeans_both_considered_child_marriages_to_be_acceptable">Americans and Europeans both considered child marriages to be acceptable</span></h4>
<p>Yes, that is correct. But note the past tense. They <i>considered</i>, not <i>consider</i>. Marriage to young girls was previously seen as normal, and yet most Americans and Europeans today, both religious and secular, find child marriages to be repulsive. Could this be because they have no uswa hasana (an excellent model of conduct) who married and had sex with a child?
</p><p>This would explain why there is not a single mainstream Christian who argues in favor of child-marriages on the basis that &quot;Saint Joseph (<a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#Mary_married_90-year-old_Joseph_when_she_was_only_12.2C_so_Joseph_was_a_pedophile_too">allegedly</a>) did it 2000 years ago&quot;, &quot;King Richard II did it 600 years ago&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> or that banning it would be &quot;un-Christian&quot;.

<p>The age of marriage in the US varies by State, but is generally 18 (with two exceptions where the minimum age is actually higher).<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> Most states, however, allow <i>minors</i> below 18 to marry (generally at 16 but sometimes lower) with parental and/or judicial consent.

</p><p>Using the State of Texas as an example; the age of marriage is 18, but with parental or judicial consent it is lowered to 14. Likewise, the age of consent is 18. However, when a girl is under the age of 17, her sexual partner can be no more than 3 years older, and it must be proven that there was no duress, i.e. there was understood consent between the couple.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Responses_to_Apologetics_-_Muhammad_and_Aisha.html#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> So a 14 year-old can have sex with a 17 year-old with consent, but not with an 18 year-old.

Last Tuesday, the Senator successfully prevented an amendment to the second part of Section 22 of the constitution by the Senate, which dwells on affirming someone as of age once the person is married, though the person could be lower than 18 years in age. He answered his critics in an online publication saying he did not deserve such criticisms. Here is the full statement: &quot;Nigeria has many uncountable problems and none of them is early marriage. As a matter of fact early marriage (is) the solution to about half of our problems. For those who wonder if I can give my daughter(s) out in marriage at the age of 9 or 13, I tell you most honestly, I can give her out at the age of 6 if I want to and it’s not your business.

But women who bonded with and submitted to their captors were more likely to have children and their children were more likely to receive the genes that made their mothers more passive and bonding towards their captors.

When forty years of age, Joseph married a woman called Melcha or Escha by some, Salome by others; they lived forty-nine years together and had six children, two daughters and four sons, the youngest of whom was James (the Less, &quot;the Lord's brother&quot;). A year after his wife's death, as the priests announced through Judea that they wished to find in the tribe of Juda a respectable man to espouse Mary, then twelve to fourteen years of age. Joseph, who was at the time ninety years old, went up to Jerusalem among the candidates; a miracle manifested the choice God had made of Joseph, and two years later the Annunciation took place. These dreams, as St. Jerome styles them, from which many a Christian artist has drawn his inspiration (see, for instance, Raphael's &quot;Espousals of the Virgin&quot;), are void of authority; they nevertheless acquired in the course of ages some popularity; in them some ecclesiastical writers sought the answer to the well-known difficulty arising from the mention in the Gospel of &quot;the Lord's brothers&quot;; from them also popular credulity has, contrary to all probability, as well as to the tradition witnessed by old works of art, retained the belief that St. Joseph was an old man at the time of marriage with the Mother of God.</i>&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08504a.htm&date=2011-10-24?url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08504a.htm&date=2011-10-24">St. Joseph</a> - Charles Souvay, The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Note that King Richard II's marriage to a child was never consummated. Although he visited his young bride nearly every day, they lived in different houses and did not sleep under the same roof, let alone in the same bed. King Richard was murdered when Queen Isabella was only eleven years old, and she was at that time still a virgin. Medieval Europeans, especially royalty, frequently arranged marriages in which one or both parties were prepubescent. But it was extremely unusual for such a marriage to be consummated before puberty.</span>

Getting married at an early age was not peculiar to the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) as some people think, but it was general for him and for his Ummah. The following are some of the actions of the Sahaba (companions): 1. Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, married his daughter, Um Kulthum to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, and she mothered a child before the death of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam). Omar got married to her while she was young before reaching the age of puberty. This is reported by Ibn Saad in 'Al-Tabaqat'. 2. From Urwa Ibn Zubair: that Zubair, may Allah be pleased with him, married his daughter when she was very young. Reported by Saeed Ibn Mansour, in his Sunnah, and Ibn Abi Shaibah, in Al-musannaf, with a Sahih chain of narration. Al-Shafie said in the book of Al-Um: &quot;Many companions of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) married their daughters while these were still young.</i>&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/61C5nBLpe">Child marriage in Islam</a>, Islamweb, Fatwa No. 88089, June 24, 2004</span>
