Then a big cloud like a shield appeared from behind it (i.e. Silas Mountain) and when it came in the middle of the sky, it spread and then rained. By Allah! We could not see the sun for a week. The next Friday, a person entered through the same gate and Allah's Apostle was delivering the Friday Khutba and the man stood in front of him and said, 'O Allah's Apostle!

They would say, &quot;That man claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.&quot; I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the 'Arabs (other than Quraish) delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca).

So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &quot;By Allah, I have come to you from the Prophet for sure!&quot; The Prophet afterwards said to them, 'Offer such-and-such prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows Qur'an most should, lead the prayer.&quot;

<div class="quotes">Swallowing bits of food that may be left between the teeth is regarded as eating, so it invalidates 
<p>the fast...
</p><p>Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni, 3/260: 
</p><p>If a person has food between his teeth, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
</p><p>1 – It is a small amount that he cannot spit out, so he swallows it. This does not invalidate his fast, because it cannot be avoided. It is like saliva. Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed on that. 
</p>
2 – It is a large amount and he can spit it out. If he spits it out there is no sin on him, but if he swallows it deliberately, his fast is invalidated according to the majority of scholars, because he has swallowed food that he could have spat out willingly when he is mindful of his fast. So this breaks the fast just as if he deliberately started eating.

<div class="quotes"><b>15. Harm No. 14: Leads to Masturbation</b><br>. . .<br>
<p>Just as it is unlawful and forbidden to commit sexual intercourse with a strange man or woman, it is likewise forbidden to masturbate.
</p><p>Unfortunately, this sin has become widespread in this day and age. In some narrations of Hadith there are severe warnings against this sin. It has been mentioned that <b>the person who masturbates shall be resurrected on the Day of Judgment with a pregnant hand</b>. It has also been mentioned that the ناکح الید (<i>the one who masturbates</i>) is under the curse of Allah. Fulfilling one's sexual desires in an unlawful manner is obviously impermissible. But one should also be cautious of excessive permissible sex. Too much sexual intercourse spoils the health and drains one's strength.
</p><p>Spiritually, one does not get enjoyment in worship and <i>Zikr</i>. If also causes the child to be born weak and frail. It is for this very reason that the Buzurgs have advised to preserve the semen. After 15 to 30 days when there is a strong urge to have sex, only then should one fulfill one's desire. The lion copulates once a year and from that it breeds offspring.
</p>
Similarly, those people who have intercourse after long intervals of time produce strong and healthy children. Therefore, moderation is necessary in sexual relations with one's wife, otherwise <b>excessive sex can even lead to death.</b> My Shaikh, <i>Hazrat Phoulpoori</i> (رحمۃ اللہ علیہ) narrated to us the incident of an <i>Alim</i> who had a very beautiful wife. Whenever he would come home from running errands and would see his wife, then he would not be able to control himself. He used have so much sexual relations that after six months, instead of discharging semen, <b>blood started to ejaculate from his penis</b>. This eventually led to a severe fever after which he died. Beauty was the cause of his death. This is why I advise to have moderation in permissible things as well. As for the unlawful, then my advice is not to even go near <i>Haraam</i>. May Allah Ta'ala grant us the ability to practice upon what has been said.
