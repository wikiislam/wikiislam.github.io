<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) <b>I never remembered my parents believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam)</b>, and (I don't remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah’s Apostle in the morning and in the evening.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/058-sbt.php#005.058.245#005.058.245">5:58:245</a></div></div>
<p>Thus ‘Aisha was either not very old or not born yet when her parents became Muslims. This is consistent with her being a child when her marriage with Muhammad was consummated.

<div class="quotes">During the same year that followed Khadijah’s death, the Prophet dreamed that he saw a man who was carrying someone wrapped in a piece of silk. The man said to him: &quot;This is thy wife, so uncover her.&quot; The Prophet lifted the silk and there was ‘A’ishah. But ‘A’ishah was only six years old, and he had passed his fiftieth year. Moreover Abu Bakr had promised her to Mut‘im for his son Jubayr. The Prophet simply said to himself: &quot;If this be from God, He will bring it to pass.&quot;...<br><br>Meantime Abu Bakr approached Mut‘im, who was persuaded without difficulty to forgo the marriage of ‘A’ishah to his son; and, some months after the marriage of Sawdah, ‘A’ishah also became the Prophet’s wife, through a marriage contracted by him and her father, at which she herself was not present. She said afterwards, that she had her first inkling of her new status when one day she was playing with her friends outside, not far from their house, and her mother came and too her by the hand and led her indoors, telling her that henceforth she must not go out to play, and that her friends must come to her instead. ‘A’ishah dimly guessed the reason, though her mother did not immediately tell her that she was married; and apart from having to play in their courtyard instead of in the roads, her life continued as before. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Aisha.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes">The Prophet and his daughters now went to live with Sawda in her new house; and after a month or two it was decided that ‘A’ishah’s wedding should take place. She was then only nine years old, a child of remarkable beauty, as might have been expected from her parentage…<br><br>Small preparations were made for the wedding- not enough, at any rate for ‘A’ishah to have had a sense of a great and solemn occasion, and shortly before they were due to leave the house she had slipped out into the courtyard to play with her passing friend. In her own words: &quot;I was playing on a see-saw and my long streaming hair was disheveled. They came and took me from my play and made me ready.&quot;<br><br>Abu Bakr had bought some fine red-striped cloth from Bahrain and it had been made into a wedding-dress for her. In this they now clothed her. Then her mother took her to the newly built house where some women of the Helpers were waiting for her outside the door. They greeted her with the words &quot;For good and for happiness- may all be well!&quot; and led her into the presence of the Prophet. He stood their smiling and combed her hair and decked her with ornaments. Unlike his other marriages, at this there was no wedding feast… then they all went their ways, and the bridegroom and the bride were left together.<br><br>For the last three years scarcely a day had passed by without one or more of ‘A’ishah’s friends coming to play with her in the courtyard adjoining her father’s house. Her removal to the Prophet’s house changed nothing in this respect. Friends now came every day to visit her in her own apartment – new friends made since her arrival in Medina and also some of the old ones whose parents, like hers, had emigrated. &quot;I would be playing with my dolls,&quot; she said, &quot;with the girls who were my friends, and the Prophet would come in and they would steal out of the house and he would go out after them and bring them back, for he was pleased for my sake to have them there.&quot; Sometimes he would say &quot;Stay where ye are&quot; before they had time to move. He would also join in their games sometimes, for he loved children and had often played with his own daughters. The dolls of puppets had many different roles. &quot;One day,&quot; said ‘A’ishah, &quot;the Prophet came in when I was playing with the dolls and he said: ‘O ‘A’ishah, whatever game is this?’ I said: ‘It is Solomon’s horses,’ and he laughed.&quot; But sometimes as he came in he would simply screen himself with his cloak so as not to disturb them. <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Aisha.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> </div>

</p>
It has not been the practice of the Muslims throughout the centuries to resort to this unlawful practice that has come to our countries from pornographic movies that the kufar (infidels) and enemies of Islam send. As for the prophet, peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, thighing his fiancée Aisha. She was six years of age and he could not have intercourse with her due to her small age.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Two_days_for_Aisha">Two days for Aisha</span></h3>
<p>Due to her aging, Muhammad wanted to divorce his second wife, Sawda. To prevent this, Sawda gave up her turn to the young Aisha.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> Narrated Aisha:<br>
Whenever Allah's Apostle wanted to go on a journey, he would draw lots as to which of his wives would accompany him. He would take her whose name came out. He used to fix for each of them a day and a night. But Sauda bint Zam'a gave up her (turn) day and night to 'Aisha, the wife of the Prophet in order to seek the pleasure of Allah's Apostle (by that action). <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/047-sbt.php#003.047.766#003.047.766">3:47:766</a>,  See also: <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/048-sbt.php#003.048.853#003.048.853">3:48:853</a>, <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3451#008.3451">8:3451</a> &amp; <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3452#008.3452">8:3452</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &quot;Sawdah feared that the Messenger of Allah might divorce her and she said, `O Messenger of Allah! Do not divorce me; give my day to `A'ishah.' And he did, and later on Allah sent down,<i>And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part, there is no sin on them both</i>.&quot; Ibn `Abbas said, &quot;Whatever (legal agreement) the spouses mutually agree to is allowed.&quot; At-Tirmidhi recorded it and said, &quot;Hasan Gharib.&quot; In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that `A'ishah said that when Sawdah bint Zam`ah became old, she forfeited her day to `A'ishah, and the Prophet used to spend Sawdah's night with `A'ishah. There is a similar narration also collected by Al-Bukhari. Al-Bukhari also recorded that `A'ishah commented: <i>And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part</i>, that it refers to, &quot;A man who is married to an old woman, and he does not desire her and wants to divorce her. So she says, `I forfeit my right on you.' So this Ayah was revealed.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=12406?sid=4&tid=12406">The Ruling Concerning Desertion on the Part of the Husband</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>
