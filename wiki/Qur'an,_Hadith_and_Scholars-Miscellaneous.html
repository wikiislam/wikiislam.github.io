<p>Khalid ibin al-Walid is one of the most celebrated and loved warriors in Islamic history. Muhammad gave him the title &quot;<a href="wiki/Saifullah.html" title="Saifullah">Sword of Allah</a>&quot;
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Anas: The Prophet had informed the people of the martyrdom of Zaid, Ja'far and Ibn Rawaha before the news of their death reached. The Prophet said, &quot;Zaid took the flag (as the commander of the army) and was martyred, then Ja'far took it and was martyred, and then Ibn Rawaha took it and was martyred.&quot; At that time the Prophet's eyes were shedding tears.

<p>Khalid was also a criminal who murdered innocent people during times of peace
</p>
<div class="quotes">The apostle sent out troops in the district round Mecca inviting men to god, he did not order them to fight. Among those he sent was Khalid bin Walid whom he ordered to go to the lower part of the flat country as a missionary; he did not send him to fight. He (Khalid) subdued Bani Jadhama and killed some of them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Ishaq 833</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Hakim bin Hakim bin Abad bin Hunayf from Abu Jafar Muhammad bin Ali said: When we took possession of Mecca the apostle sent Khalid forth as a missionary. He did not send him to fight. He had with him the Arab tribes Sulam bin Mansur and Mudlij Bin Murra, and they subdued Bani Jadhama Bin Amir bin Kinana. When the people saw him they grasped their weapons and Khalid said “Lay down your arms for everybody has accepted Islam”
<p>A traditionist of Bani Jadhima who was one of four companions told me: When Khalid ordered us to lay down our arms one of our men called Jadham Said “Woe to you, Bani Jadhama! This is Khalid. If you lay down your arms you will be bound, and after you have been bound you will be beheaded. By god, I will never lay down my arms” Some of his people laid hold of him saying “Do you want to shed our blood? Everyone else has accepted Islam and laid down their arms; war is over and everybody safe.” They persisted to the point of taking away his arms, and they themselves laid down their arms at Khalid’s word.”
</p>
Hakim bin Hakim from Abu Jafar Muhammad bin Ali told me: As soon as they had laid down their arms Khalid ordered their hands to be tied behind their backs and put them to the sword, killing a number of them. When the news reached the apostle he raised his hands to heaven and said “O God, I am innocent before thee of what Khalid has done”<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Ishaq 834</div></div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Hadith">Other Hadith</span></h2>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Samura bin Jundub: 
Allah's Apostle very often used to ask his companions, &quot;Did anyone of you see a dream?&quot; So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, &quot;Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, 'Proceed!' I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?' They said, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&quot; I think the Prophet said, &quot;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' And so we proceeded and came across a river.&quot; I think he said, &quot;.... red like blood.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, 'Who are these (two) persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, 'Go up and I went up' The Prophet added, &quot;So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.&quot; The Prophet further added, &quot;My two companions (angels) said to me, 'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, 'That (palace) is your place.' I said to them, 'May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied, 'As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to them, 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' They replied, 'We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, <b>he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world</b>. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).&quot; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! What about the children of pagans?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;And also the children of pagans.&quot; The Prophet added, &quot;My two companions added, 'The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/087-sbt.php#009.087.171#009.087.171">9:87:171</a></div></div>
