<div class="quotes">Despite legal and religious restrictions against abortion in much of the Arab world, changing social values and economic realities as well as demographic shifts have contributed to an apparent increase in the number of the procedures in the Middle East.<br>. . .<br>
<p>&quot;I think abortions are going up for just for one reason: Sex is becoming more permissive,&quot; said Wissam Ghandour, a Lebanese obstetrician and scholar. &quot;I assure you that <b>the majority of girls getting married now are non-virgins and sexually active</b>.&quot;<br>. . .<br>
Statistics are sparse. Family planning experts said they detected a <b>100% increase in the number of abortions from two decades ago</b>.<br>. . .<br>
According to the United Nations, about <b>one in 10 pregnancies in the region ends in abortion</b>, <br>. . .<br>
</p>
A study by the International Planned Parenthood Federation estimated there were <b>7 million abortions in the Arab world</b> from 1995 to 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-Los_Angeles_Times_Abortion_Statistics_1-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-Los_Angeles_Times_Abortion_Statistics-1">[1]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2008</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Unsafe abortion is one of the most neglected public health challenges in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,* where an estimated one in four pregnancies are unintended—wanting to have a child later or wanting no more children.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Many women with unintended pregnancies resort to clandestine abortions that are not safe.

The relationships sometimes <b>begin as romantic involvements, often with under-aged minors, and develop into rape, abductions and abuse</b>.
<p>Seven victims last month alone are aged 11-18. These are only cases that were reported to police, but many others are believed to have taken place without being reported.
</p><p>Complaints were filed to the police in four cases of such abductions last month in Kiryat Malachi alone, and a fifth case of rape.
</p><p>Voice of Israel radio said that all four cases of abductions in Kiryat Malachi involved young Bedouin men. The rape took place on the Ashkelon beach last weekend.
</p><p>In one of the abduction cases, two men from the Bedouin city of Rahat, aged 40 and 24, were arrested, but one has since been released.
</p><p>In the rape case, the main suspect is a resident of the Palestinian Authority who is illegally staying inside pre-1967 Israel. He has been charged and two other Arabs who were also present at the scene of the crime face lesser charges.
</p><p>Voice of Israel's reporter in southern Israel, Asaf Kuzailov, said that the phenomenon is on the rise and is a well known one – to residents, to police and welfare authorities. It is confirmed by the Center for Assistance to Women in the Negev.<br>. . .<br>
Yad L'Achim says about <b>1,000 cases of Jewish girls being held against their will by Arabs occur every year</b>.
</p><p>The Family Lobby, which blames a breakdown in parental -- and particularly paternal -- authority in the Jewish sector for the problem, noted that the Israeli feminist movement and women's organizations do nothing to raise public awareness of Arab predatory behavior against Jewish girls, as that would negate their leftist credo.
</p>
&quot;While separation of buses in the hareidi sector and religious soldiers' requests to be excused from immodest performances receive top headlines for months on end, thanks to militant feminist politicians and journalists, actual rape and abduction of minor girls is swept under the rug by these groups because it is carried out by their Arab darlings,&quot; the group's chairman, Gil Ronen, said. &quot;Unfortunately, nationalist and religious women have not made an effort to forge an independent agenda for their women's groups on this issue, and are content to be led by the ultra-leftists, who use them for bashing religious men and Jewish religion in general.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">December 2011</div></div>

<p>68% of Punjabi Girls and 32% of Punjabi boys have been Molested (90% of Punjabis are Muslim)
</p>
<div class="quotes">Paedophilia in Punjab reaching alarming levels<br>. . .<br>
<p>It has been two years since the National Child Protection Bill was tabled before parliament. The proposed piece of legislation could have been a breakthrough for innocent girls and boys being molested and murdered across the country, but the lack of interest on part of the parliamentarians clearly shows that there is no chance of the bill getting approved. Likewise, the Punjab government has also continuously failed to implement pledges of stern action against criminals of child molestation, trying them under the Anti-Terrorism Act. 
</p><p>According to the recent statistics given by SAHIL, a non-government organisation, Punjab is on the top of the list for child molestation with 62 percent of such cases, 154 in Lahore and the rest in other cities of Punjab.
</p><p><b>In total, 68 percent girls and 32 percent boys have been the victims of paedophilia. The number increased by 9.4 percent as compared to 2008. Statistics show that around 81 percent of the cases were registered with the police. The study shows that 2,012 children were reportedly abused in 2009 and most of them were abused by acquaintances.</b> 
</p><p>The report says that children from the 11 to 15 age-group are amongst the most vulnerable, followed by the age-group 6 to 10. Out of a total 2,012 victims, 6 percent of the children were murdered after being sexually assaulted. However, 0.5 percent cases were of those children who were murdered during an “attempt” of sexual assault. 
</p><p>According to the study, “it is difficult to collect actual data regarding child molestation as the abusers threaten children not to share such experiences, even with parents”. 
</p>
Cases: Even in cases where the molesters are revealed, people are unable to bring them to the book without solid evidence. Due to lack of evidence and social stigma, parents of molested children often choose to stay silent, hence these incidents go ignored.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">July 2010</div></div>

</p><p>“Children are raped because they are easily accessible and vulnerable,” she said. “They are murdered after the rape to protect the predator’s identity. It is difficult to kill an adult.” Zaman added that in their meetings it was suggested that around 50 cases of sexual violence were not reported because of two main reasons. In some cases, the police refused to file a complaint and in the other, the families were reluctant to talk about it.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Turkey">Turkey</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">According to figures provided by the state Social Services and Child Protection Agency (SHÇEK), 2,678 -- 18 percent -- of the 14,398 children currently living in SHÇEK homes have been subject to physical or sexual abuse by their parents. “The number of children pushed into crime has been rising by 5 to 10 percent annually. On average, 125,000 children appear before the courts each year. Thirty-four percent of children below the age of 6 are living in poverty across the country; and that figure is around 40 percent in rural areas. Although we have good legislation on child rights, most of it is not being applied as it should be,” Polat said. He also noted that about 37 percent of Turkey’s street children had run away from homes in the East and Southeast, the most impoverished regions of the country. 
<p>Noting that according to Justice Ministry figures, 7,000 children are subject to sexual harassment and rape annually, Polat noted that the frequency of incest incidents and sexual crimes against children by members of their families have been consistently increasing. In 2000, 7 percent of the children placed in SHÇEK homes were there as a result of sexual abuse at home, but that percentage has risen to 15 percent over the past few years.
</p><p>The unofficial figures are frightening. According to a study conducted by the Association for the Rehabilitation of Children and their Protection from Abuse (ÇİKORED), 58 percent of all girls and 42 percent of all boys whose mothers have been accepted by a women’s shelter in the country have also been subject to sexual abuse at home. Nearly all of the women who have taken refuge from domestic violence at these shelters, 92 percent, beat their own children regularly, ÇİKORED’s study in women’s shelters found.<br>. . .<br>
Associate Professor Figen Şahin, chairwoman of the Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect and director of the Child Protection Center at Gazi University, spoke to Today’s Zaman, claiming that about 35 percent of the children in Turkey suffer from physical abuse and that 30 percent are victims of sexual abuse.
</p>
“There are no reliable statistics about the sexual abuse of children in Turkey. There have been several studies, though. Some of them suggest that 4 percent of children are victims of incest in the country while some others have found this number to be as high as 18 percent. However, these figures are the tip of the iceberg. It has been found that 35 percent of the children in Turkey are subject to physical violence. Beating is used as a method of education. Although there are different interpretations of the data on sexual abuse, it is obvious that the molesters are primarily people trusted by the victims. About 50 percent of the molesters come from among the relatives and close circles of the children’s families. In general, molestation is not done by force, but through deception,” she said.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2008</div></div>

<p>Study finds religious Muslim boys are more violent than other boys
</p>
<div class="quotes">A study that shows boys growing up in religious Muslim families are more likely to be violent seems set to reignite the debate over religion and integration, a media report said on Sunday.
<p>The study, which involved intensive questioning of 45,000 teenagers from 61 towns and regions across the country, was conducted by Christian Pfeiffer of the criminal research institute of Lower Saxony.
</p><p><b>Pfeiffer said he was dismayed by the results, and told the Süddeutsche Zeitung he was a strong critic of political campaigns which painted foreigners as criminals – such as those led by Roland Koch and Thilo Sarrazin.</b>
</p><p>Pfeiffer’s work took into account the level of education and standard of living in the families of the children – aged between 14 and 16 – who were questioned. He also asked them how religious they considered themselves, and how integrated they felt in Germany.<b> </b>
</p><p>Pfeiffer said that even when other social factors were taken into account, there remained a significant correlation between religiosity and readiness to use violence. There were some positive correlations too he said, noting that young religious Muslims were much less likely than their non-Muslim counterparts to drink alcohol – or to steal from shops. 
</p><p>The increased likelihood to use violence was restricted to Muslim boys Pfeiffer said – Muslim girls were just as likely to be violent as non-Muslim girls.
<br>. . .<br>
His researchers asked the teenagers a range of questions about their ideas of manliness, for example whether they thought a man was justified in hitting his wife if she had been unfaithful. They also asked about what media and computer game violence they were exposed to, as well as whether their friends were involved in crime or violence. 
</p><p><b>The results showed that Muslim boys from immigrant families were more than twice as likely to agree with macho statements than boys from Christian immigrant families. The rate was highest among those considered as very religious, Pfeiffer said. They were also more likely to be using violent computer games and have criminal friends. </b>
</p>
Added to that, the more religious Muslim boys felt the least integrated into German society, with only 14.5 percent of the very religious Turkish boys (the largest group of Muslims in the study) saying they felt German, although 88.5 percent had been born here.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2010</div></div>

<div class="quotes">In Bangladesh, Christian children from Tripuri tribes have been taken away from their villages and forcibly converted to Islam. Local Catholic sources, who asked their names be withheld, told AsiaNews that <b>almost 300 children have been taken to madrassas (Islamic schools</b>).
<p>The story is the same. So-called intermediaries, who are also ethnic Tripuri, visit poverty-stricken communities where they convince families to send their children to a mission hostel, charging between 6,000 and 15,000 taka (US$ 500 to 1,200) for school and board. After pocketing the money, the intermediaries sell the children to Islamic schools elsewhere in the country.
</p>
The latest case involved 11 children, ten boys and a girl, from Thanchi, Ruma and Lama in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Their story has a happy ending though. After six months of threats and violence, the children were able to escape thanks Hotline Human Rights Trust, a Dhaka-based civil rights organisation that defends minorities run by a Catholic woman, Rosaline Costa.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2012</div></div>

<div class="quotes">In a study of two prison in Greater Jakarta, <b>only 9 percent of juvenile offenders had access to lawyers, 74 percent shared their cells with adult criminals and 98 percent had reported torture</b>, the Jakarta Legal Aid Foundation says. 
<p>The foundation’s study, which was released on Wednesday, drew from interviews with 100 juvenile offenders at Tangerang Penitentiary in Banten and Pondok Bambu Juvenile Penitentiary in Jakarta between January 2010 and January 2012. 
</p><p>“As many as 74 percent [of those surveyed] said they couldn’t go to school and their education had been halted during the legal process,” said Muhammad Isnur, an advocate for the foundation, known as LBH Jakarta. 
</p><p>Isnur said 98 percent of respondents reported enduring some form of torture while the police tried to solicit a confession or information from them. 
</p>
Although Indonesia ratified a law on juvenile courts in 1997, the country lacks a justice system specifically designed for young delinquents and law enforcers often use a punitive approach for young offenders.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Children.html#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">April 2012</div></div>
