<p>Tafsirs on verse 65:4.
</p>
<div class="quotes">The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. [see 2:228] <b>The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation.</b> Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=65&tid=54196?sid=65&tid=54196">The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses (Qur'an 65:4)</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Here, one should bear in mind the fact that according to the explanations given in the Quran the question of the waiting period arises in respect of the women with whom marriage may have been consummated, for there is no waiting-period in case divorce is pronounced before the consummation of marriage. (Al-Ahzab: 49). Therefore, <b>making mention of the waiting-period for the girls who have not yet menstruated, clearly proves that it is not only permissible to give away the girl in marriage at this age but it is also permissible for the husband to consummate marriage with her.</b> Now, obviously no Muslim has the right to forbid a thing which the Quran has held as permissible.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=65?sura=65">Commentary on Qur'an Chapter 65:4</a><br>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, Tafhim al-Qur'an</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Surah al-Talaaq 65:4: 
If a woman does not menstruate, either because she is very young or old and past menopause, then her ‘iddah is three months, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses (i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Pedophilia.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Majmoo’at As’ilah tahumm al-Usrah al-Muslimah, p. 61-63</div></div>

<div class="quotes">The Noble Qur'an has also mentioned the waiting period [i.e. for a divorced wife to remarry] for the wife who has not yet menstruated, saying: &quot;And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women - if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated&quot; [Qur'an 65:4]. Since this is not negated later, <b>we can take from this verse that it is permissible to have sexual intercourse with a prepubescent girl</b>. The Qur'an is not like the books of jurisprudence which mention what the implications of things are, even if they are prohibited. <b>It is true that the prophet (PBUH) entered into a marriage contract with A'isha when she was six years old, however he did not have sex with her until she was nine years old</b>, according to al-Bukhari.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http:%2F%2Fwww.islamonline.net%2Far%2FIOLCounsel_C%2F1278406761316%2F1278406720653%2F%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%9F-&date=2011-02-03?url=http:%2F%2Fwww.islamonline.net%2Far%2FIOLCounsel_C%2F1278406761316%2F1278406720653%2F%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%9F-&date=2011-02-03">Is it permissible to restrict the age at which girls can marry?</a><br>Submitted by Ahmad, IslamOnline, December 24, 2010</div></div>

<p>Moreover, the interest of Shariah proves it. So the claim that this was abrogated is not correct. And the Hadith did not include that meaning; it just states that a virgin woman is not to be married until consulted. 
</p><p>The evidence from the Qur'an is: 
</p><p>1.

<div class="quotes">Getting married at an early age is something that is confirmed by the book of Allah, the Sunnah of his Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam), the consensus of the scholars and the actions of the companions, and the Muslims who came after them... 
<p><b>There are many Ahadith which confirm that marriage at an early age was widespread among the companions and no one denied its permissibility.</b> Getting married at an early age was not peculiar to the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) as some people think, but it was general for him and for his Ummah.
</p><p>The following are some of the actions of the Sahaba (companions):
</p><p>1. Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, married his daughter, Um Kulthum to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, and she mothered a child before the death of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam). <b>Omar got married to her while she was young before reaching the age of puberty</b>. This is reported by Ibn Saad in 'Al-Tabaqat'.
</p><p>2. From Urwa Ibn Zubair: that Zubair, may Allah be pleased with him, married his daughter when she was very young. Reported by Saeed Ibn Mansour, in his Sunnah, and Ibn Abi Shaibah, in Al-musannaf, with a Sahih chain of narration.
</p><p>Al-Shafie said in the book of Al-Um: &quot;Many companions of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) married their daughters while these were still young.&quot;
</p><p><b>Delaying the marriage of girls in many Muslim countries is something new and contradictory to what Muslims used to do over many centuries. This is because of westernization and the application of man-made laws. This caused a change in understandings and customs within a considerable number of the population, and it is absolutely not permissible to consider the customs and traditions in a given country as the standard by which people abide, and fail to obey the absolute evidences of Shariah</b>.
</p><p>In some Muslim countries, the marriage for girls has been delayed by many years beyond the age of puberty. This has indeed led to an increase in the removal of the veil from the face, and increased fornication and adultery, as well as the emergence of deviation in conduct and religion among the youth. They had become morally unstable as they lack affection, chastity, and protection their private parts from illegal sexual relations.
</p>
By delaying marriage, there is also a reduction in the number of Muslims in the Ummah, and this is contrary to the order of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam), as he ordered us to have many children so that the Muslim nation will be greater in number than the previous nations.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/61C5nBLpe">Child marriage in Islam</a><br>Islamweb, Fatwa No. 88089, June 24, 2004</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Everything that is not forbidden is permitted.  [The new law in Yemen that set the minimum marriage age at 17] is a Western plot aimed at Westernizing our culture.

<div class="quotes">m3.13 Guardians are of two types, those who may compel their female charges to marry someone, and those who may not.<br><br>
<ol><li>The only guardians who may compel their charge to marry are a virgin bride's father or father's father, compel meaning to marry her to a suitable match (def: m4) without her consent.</li>
<li>Those who may not compel her are not entitled to marry her to someone unless she accepts and gives her permission.</li></ol>
<br>Whenever the bride is a virgin, the father or father's father may marry her to someone without her permission, though it is recommended to ask her permission <b>if</b> she has reached puberty.

The only exeption is in the case of the father and his daughter who is less than nine years of age. There is no harm if he gets her married while she is less than nine years old, according to the correct opinion. This is based on the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) marrying Aisha without her consent when she was less than nine years old, as is stated in authentic Hadith...<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Pedophilia.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shaikh ibn Baz's answer on the Q &amp; A site of the Muslim Students Organization of the University of Houston</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Scholars have discussed at length the marriage of a young girl who has not attained puberty and whether her father may marry her away without her permission. If such a marriage takes place it is valid. However, it is <b>perhaps</b> best if the marriage is not allowed to be consummated until the girl attains puberty, when she is given the choice whether to continue with this marriage or not.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Pedophilia.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Adil Salahi</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Banning child marriage will cause challenging the marriage of the holy prophet of Islam, who also married minor Ayesha, when she was just eight years old. The new law [seeking to ban child marriages] initiated by the current government [of Bangladesh] will put the moral character of the prophet into controversy and challenge. Islam permits child marriage and it will not be tolerated if any ruler will ever try to touch this issue in the name of giving more rights to women.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Pedophilia.html#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Mufti Fazlul Haque Amini</div></div>
