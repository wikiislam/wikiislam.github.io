<p>Hi. That page uses title-case for capitalization of headings<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="wiki/WikiIslam-Standardization.html#Section_headings">[1]</a>. And there should not be multiple Qur'an translations used to illustrate a single error (i.e choose only one translation from the USC site). Both those errors were in your first edit to the page but I fixed them<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="w/index.php.html?title=Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur%27an&diff=102143&oldid=102140">[2]</a>.

<dd>I've reverted your edit again. You are aware this talk page discussion has been initiated.

<dd>No they don't mind. Quality standards are high on this wiki. If editors do not have the time to adhere to guidelines/stick to proper etiquette or take the care to format their contributions properly, we'd rather they not edit at all. Do you think it's fair if others have to waste their time cleaning up after someone else's edits?

<p>hi Saggy, this Science error/Quran page is popular and is often linked to by people so its important for this page to be as strong as possible. Some errors are more obvious than others. Some only appear in one translation and so on. For example the Golden Calf statue verse that you added was great. It obviously goes against science and is a glaring error while some others are not that obvious.
</p><p>One idea I have is to keep the strongest errors at the top and the less obvious ones (or the ones that can be explained in some way by apologists) near the bottom in another section. I tried making some rules here: <a href="wiki/Talk-Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an.html" title="Talk:Scientific Errors in the Qur'an" class="mw-redirect">Talk:Scientific Errors in the Qur'an</a> (draft). Let me know your thoughts. --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a>) 08:19, 1 February 2014 (PST)

<dd>How can we judge weakness? Its is everyones POV. EG Every claim about the sky is weak on its own. But when put together its a huge blunder. We already have sections for the branchs of science. At most we'll put weak claims at bottom of each section. of course we mustnt say - xyz is a weaker claim , we can try to explian it or justifiy it as much as possible..<a href="wiki/User-Saggy.html" title="User:Saggy">Saggy</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 12:52, 1 February 2014 (PST)

<dd>Hi, I moved your comment back to keep it in one place. Some errors are present in Arabic and the translations, while others are present only in the translations. For example Constellations. Apologetist might say the Quran just means &quot;collections of light&quot; and yes these were made by Allah for humans (for example) and he was just talking in a general sense. A more glaring error is the Golden statue or mathematics of inheritance. So some are more obvious, the others are a little iffy and have some conditions. 
</dd>
<dd>You might have some good points, I'm myself unsure about this issue so I'm just talking about it to see if there's any concrete ideas. So thats one idea, to put weak claims at the bottom. 
</dd>
<dd>Another suggestion is to look at other websites like Answering-Islam and expand on the evidence for these errors, for example with arabic or tafsir.
</dd>
<dd>Another thing. Verses should be checked against the 3 translators to make sure those are the only ones we're using. I saw an instance where there was another translation being used and it was corrected. I will try to go through all of them.
</dd>
<dd>Anyone else have anything about this? --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a>) 16:06, 1 February 2014 (PST)

<dd>3 translators is ok. but we cant cry about translation matters in the article itself or lose content bcoz of them. on the long run give Every claim its main article like we have lying forehead or sunset in a muddy spring. As for constellations, other translations are &quot;towers&quot; or &quot;mansions&quot;- Both are disgusting if we take them literaly. And the calf statue may be defended by just calling it a miracle. <a href="wiki/User-Saggy.html" title="User:Saggy">Saggy</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 23:05, 1 February 2014 (PST)

<dd>Just a quick pointer for Saggy concerning that page; readers should not be directly addressed. So rather than say, <i>&quot;What will this beast be like? How come it will be able to talk to people?&quot;</i>, it should say something like, <i>&quot;The Qur'an does not elaborate on the physical appearance of this beast or how it would communicate with humans&quot;</i>. The Isra and Mi'raj section seems to have it right. <a href="wiki/User-Sahab.html" title="User:Sahab">--Sahab</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Sahab.html" title="User talk:Sahab">talk</a>) 13:51, 25 February 2014 (PST)

<dd>Yea, we'll have to work on that after the verses have been put in.
</dd>
<dd>Saggy how are you finding these verses? Through search or by reading the verses yourself and searching for issues? Any plans of getting more?

<dd>Still not sure about the article or where it will go but I think its a good idea (needs more verses though). Its different than the usual &quot;errors/contradictions&quot; and so on.

That same hadith continues by saying, &quot;A single endeavor in Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets.&quot; If we apply your logic to the rest of the same narration, it would mean that the &quot;Orbit of the Sun is comparable to a single endeavor in Allah's Cause&quot; is also a valid interpretation, something which it is not.

<dd>Suppose you wanted to say the same thing, no matter if it sounds good or mediocre: &quot;A place as small as X is better than that on which Y happens.&quot;  Of course &quot;that&quot; could refer to &quot;place &quot; better than to &quot;X&quot;. But if X is not something typically <i>small,</i> what is the point in saying it? <i>Bow</i> must have the other meaning (which is backed up by that sun travelling-prostrating and permission verse) Come on, u could have said as small as... anything. Why bow? You can think of several adjectives on hearing the word bow, except &quot;small.&quot; Whether this was narrated at war (single endeavor) or some other hadith sounds partly similar, does not matter. That could be a change of the simile made in the first place. Is a place anything like a bow? The sun rises and sets? Not at all. Only a person who thinks the sun runs on a semicircle over the other place(earth) would have said &quot;bow.&quot; <a href="wiki/User-Saggy.html" title="User:Saggy">Saggy</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 10:53, 6 April 2014 (PDT)

<dd><b>&quot;But if X is not something typically <i>small,</i> what is the point in saying it?&quot;</b>
</dd>
<dd>A bow is small in comparison to the earth or in comparison to a lot of things.
</dd>
<dd><b>&quot;<i>Bow</i> must have the other meaning&quot;</b>
</dd>
<dd>You only assert that it must, but you haven't provided any convincing reasons why. 
</dd>
<dd><b>&quot;Come on, u could have said as small as... anything. Why bow?&quot;</b>
</dd>
<dd>Because they were warriors and Muhammad was describing where they would go when they die in battle. Is that really too much of a stretch? No, it makes perfect sense. In fact it's what most people would get from reading that verse. Your explanation just comes of as a stretch.
</dd>
<dd><b>&quot;You can think of several adjectives on hearing the word bow, except &quot;small.&quot;&quot;</b>
</dd>
<dd>Words such as &quot;dying&quot; and &quot;in battle&quot; spring to mind. And I don't agree with your &quot;except small&quot; comment. A bow is small in comparison to the world, so there is no valid reason why it could not be described as &quot;small&quot;.
</dd>
<dd><b>&quot;Whether this was narrated at war (single endeavor) or some other hadith sounds partly similar, does not matter.&quot;</b>
</dd>
<dd>Of course it does. That is what we call &quot;context&quot;. Context is what helps us understand the meanings behind text. It is what Muslim apologists usually ignore. And of course what &quot;some other hadith sounds partly similar&quot; says is important. It's important because it is describing the exact same event, but via a different narrator. Even the one hadith you are misinterpreting debunks your ideas when read fully (refer to my original post)'
</dd>
<dd><b>&quot;Is a place anything like a bow?&quot;</b>
</dd>
<dd>The hadith does not claim any place is like a bow, it is referring to the size of the bow. You don't need that to be explained. It is written in plain English for everyone to see (i.e. &quot;as <i>small</i> as a bow&quot;).
</dd>
<dd><b>&quot;Only a person who thinks the sun runs on a semicircle over the other place(earth) would have said &quot;bow.&quot;&quot;</b> 
</dd>
<dd>You havn't shown that at all. Your reasoning is convoluted and ignores the obvious meaning. I would suggest sticking to hadiths that are clear errors rather than ones that need your interpretations. <a href="wiki/User-Sahab.html" title="User:Sahab">--Sahab</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Sahab.html" title="User talk:Sahab">talk</a>) 12:10, 6 April 2014 (PDT)

Saggy, so that we're clear this is the the hadith:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 51: Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &quot;A place in Paradise as small as a bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world).&quot; He also said, &quot;A single endeavor in Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Breaking it up, &quot;X is better than Y&quot;. 
</p><p>X = &quot;A place in Paradise as small as a bow.&quot; (a small sized object)
</p><p>Y = &quot;all that on which the sun rises and sets&quot; (some kind of large space according to the Quran)
</p><p>Your title was &quot;Orbit of the Sun is comparable to a Bow&quot;. This is incorrect. The <i>size</i> of a bow is being compared to the size of the sun's place of rising and setting.
</p><p>The hadith means &quot;A tiny place in Islamic Heaven is better than a huge place which is not part of Heaven&quot;. 
</p><p>If you're talking about the arc of a bow (golden part <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://3dmagicmodels.com/wp-content/uploads/bow-and-arrow-3d-model1.jpg">here</a> which is a semi circle) being compared to what an observer on Earth sees, this is not an error. We see that kind of semi-circle even today as we see the sun form an arc. A scientist can say &quot;look how the Sun makes (or seems to make) a semi circle around the Earth&quot;. So these things can be explained. This is like the horseman hadith where there wasnt any interpretation like the one you were saying there was. As again if you come across a hadith and you're not sure of the meaning you can ask us. On the other hand, the hadith could be added to as supporting evidence (&quot;the sun rises and sets&quot;): <a href="wiki/Geocentrism_and_the_Quran.html#Muslims_around_the_time_of_Muhammad" title="Geocentrism and the Quran">Geocentrism_and_the_Quran#Muslims_around_the_time_of_Muhammad</a> but I think its weak on its own on the Errors page: --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 12:46, 6 April 2014 (PDT)

<dd>Hi Ax. Yeah, I've removed it. Even with those surrounding hadith, this particular hadith is not making any reference whatsoever to the orbit of the sun. If I can see this and you can see this, then so can most other people. As you noted, the object being &quot;compared&quot; to the bow is something <i>other</i> than the sun itself. There is not &quot;ifs&quot; or &quot;buts&quot; about it. The second hadith down from that one confirms the meaning (which was obvious anyway.). It's like a Muslim saying a can of Pepsi is more refreshing than all that is inside a coffee cup, then us accusing him of saying a ceramic cup is more refreshing than a soft drink. <a href="wiki/User-Sahab.html" title="User:Sahab">--Sahab</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Sahab.html" title="User talk:Sahab">talk</a>) 13:20, 6 April 2014 (PDT)

<dd>We have an (old) article about the very same contradiction mentioned by Saggy (<a href="wiki/Muhammads_Miracles.html" title="Muhammads Miracles">Muhammad's Miracles</a>). If you read the section on Bukhari's criteria, you'll see that Muslims have contradictions between the Qur'an and Hadith covered. Thus it renders the article completely pointless. In fact, Muslims will probably think it's funny and talk about how we don't know anything about the &quot;science of hadith&quot;. That's on top of the fact that such an article would only be used for Qur'anist propaganda. If the very idea is pointless, then I don't see any benefit from letting an editor waste their time working on it.

<dl>
<dd>Here I've made a page for you that gives you the freedom to do any kind of QHS work (since that is something you like doing). You can reorganize content there using section headings (logical error, hadith errors, contradictions, etc):
</dd>
<dd><a href="wiki/User-Saggy/Sandbox_-_Issues_with_Quran_and_Hadith.html" title="User:Saggy/Sandbox - Issues with Quran and Hadith">User:Saggy/Sandbox - Issues with Quran and Hadith</a> - use this for any new work or new ideas to keep it in the same place.
</dd>
<dd>Just keep in mind that we can have a democratic discussion together later on as to whether certain content will be approved or not for conversion from sandbox to main space. My view is that interesting QHS can be re-used in other places too in some way so if you have discovered verses or hadiths that are interesting, it is totally OK for them to go in a personal sandbox page of your own. Sandboxes are all excluded from Google search so no one can find them unless they come to recent changes/contributions and explore that way. Doing this does not harm the quality of the main content as sandbox content has to be carefully reviewed to make sure it complies with guidelines and the mission.
</dd>
<dd>You can keep adding content for existing pages as you are doing (Scientific errors in hadith, in the Quran, Contradictions in the Quran etc.) As before we will review those to see if they are ok as that is content in the main space.
</dd>
<dd>Doing a short reply for Sahab, if Quranists want to use content on our site for any purpose, its a good thing. It brings them to our site and they have effectively approved content on our site (I think its a plus for us). They're a minority so I would not worry about them. I can make many more points but my point is that all alternatives can be argued for equally. There are advantages and disadvantages for each alternative.

<dd><i>&quot;Let's go all the way and invalidate 95% of our material just to keep 1 editor happy.&quot;</i> ----  :-) this is an imaginary situation that hasn't happened yet so lets not do that.
</dd>
<dd>He knows its a Sandbox page that later may or may not be approved so whats the issue? I dont see any.
</dd>
<dd><i>&quot;Mat'n applies to ALL contradictions between the Qur'an and hadith.&quot;</i> - is Bukhari's criteria the golden absolute rule on deciding whats a contradiction? I would say no. To me a Sahih hadith is Sahih. I would say that Bukhari does not have the authority to invalidate the Hadiths of other Hadith collectors (like Muslim). Also if the criteria is to delete things that are in contradiction with each other, the Quran contradicts itself in various verses, so what does one do about that? To most people they are all valid Islamic sources (especially Sahih hadiths). All these points can be mentioned on a page about Quran/hadith contradictions. All of these things seen together expose more serious problems with Islam and create challenges for people reading them.
</dd>
<dd><i>&quot;My point is that it ONLY benefits their propaganda&quot;</i> - Again they are a minority. The other side effect is letting the rest of the Muslims know that these contradictions exist. Most Muslims view hadiths as holy. I would say that they would have to deal with the contradiction when they see it and it creates a challenge for them.
</dd>
<dd> My main point here again is that cases can be argued against equally.

<dd>You have not dealt with anything I've actually said, so no they can't be argued against equally. I've mentioned several times why I deleted that page from the sandbox but you continue acting like I never explained. Your opinion on Bukhari's criteria is irrelevant. Mat'n is a well known thing. Hence, contradictions between the Qur'an and certain hadith will not effect mainstream Islam in the slightest. And wth, you're telling editors to stay away from me now?

Are there are sources to support what Matn means? As I mentioned, the issue of deletion arises at the point of review when something is being considered for main space but not before that when it is in a temporary condition (in the Sandbox). Saggy knows it may or may not be approved. As for whether you're right or I'm right, I've shown that points can be made on both sides.

<dd>To hightlight it again our page <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="wiki/Muhammads_Miracles.html">[13]</a> that you pointed to in the begining and you refered to it again, claims <i>&quot;His third criteria is mat'n, i.e. the content of a narration must not be in contradiction with the Qur'an.&quot;</i>, but there's no reference for that. According to other sources Matn means &quot;text of the hadith&quot;, not &quot;must not be in contradiction with the Quran&quot;. Bukhari's criteria of this contradiction cannot apply to other Hadith scholars (it is his own personal opinion). And even if we were to assume such a criteria, we are faced by the question: Is a Sahih hadith being declared invalid simply because of the contradiction? Why was it considered in the first place if it was actually invalid? The hadith was considered authentic because the events narrated actually happened.

<dd>Pointing out contradictions between Quran and hadith is a criticism of Islam. Our site's mission is criticism of Islam (or to provide &quot;an accurate and comprehensive resource on Islam&quot; as currently mentioned in the <a href="wiki/WikiIslam-Frequently_Asked_Questions.html#What_is_the_purpose_of_WikiIslam.3F" title="WikiIslam:Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a>, which is even more inclusive), not whether certain criticism is seen as favorable to certain minority sects of Islam like Quran-only. 
</dd>
<dd>And as I mentioned (sorry if I'm repeating some points), this certain criticism is not seen as favorable to the majority of Muslims who do believe in the hadith. The Matn contradiction issue is Bukhari's opinion and cannot invalidate all problematic hadiths, (definitely not other hadiths like Muslim and neither his own) just because he said so. In short again that means we should not be excluding criticism of Islam because it is favoring a minority sect. And again, we will have a full picture of the situation when there is an actual article to review which there is none at this time. Its just text in a Sandbox. In an article like this Quran/hadith contradiction issue, we definitely want to point out clearly that people can not simply reject Sahih hadiths for whatever reason. There was a reason they were considered Sahih. Sometimes a certain issue is covered in multiple Hadiths which adds to the strength of what the Hadith is saying. If there are multiple Hadith collectors (Muslim and Bukhari for example) that is even more evidence that a Hadith's content actually happened and it is difficult to reject that hadith. So we should wait to see what an article looks like in the end to give a full opinion. The other issue again is, if Contradiction is the reason to reject a hadith, Quranic verses which contradict each other also have a problem. As for Atheistig's article, I dont know what that situation was and perhaps we missed a chance on making a valid article but I dont know enough details. Having an article that mentions Quran/hadith contradictions provides motivation for further strengthening the position that it is not possible to reject hadiths and definitely not Sahih hadiths, so it provides motivation for further improving the &quot;Quran only - Why it is not possible&quot; article or any other content like that. --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 04:21, 12 April 2014 (PDT)

<dd>U quote years and still insist on days? Reckoning means our &quot;count&quot; not days or years. Everywhere online the meaning is 1000/50000 years not days. Of course it is same perspective for everyone. Time flows the same for all ( we or anyone outside the solarsystem). The measurement and units differ. (This also debunks the Einsteins theory of relativity miracle claim for the above verses). A day for us is 24 hours. Nobody can change this. Day is defined by a planets rotation! His day is nothing to do with our 24 hrs in anyway! Why do i even need to say this when the equation is about years? Let me show one more : &quot;He regulates the affair from the heaven to the earth; then shall it ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count&quot; 32:5.

<dd>&quot;your hearts&quot;. Thus it is not for one person but plural. The earlier verses are not clear on who the audience is(a common goof). If there is a claim of a miracle with tafsirs or stuff to back up (Ibn kathir and Ibn abbas have nothing to say), we can post it under miracles. one site said there are two battles in the single verse (Uhud and Badr) but it is not entirely true to them. <a href="wiki/User-Saggy.html" title="User:Saggy">Saggy</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 23:47, 17 April 2014 (PDT)

<dd>Strong errors are long since covered so we have only these. We can rearange them within their section as I think i said. Another site &quot;islamfrominside.com&quot; says everything is about Badr but Wikipedia does not say so. Apologists have four effects of rain to explain infact. The last &quot;feet&quot; one differs in translations. Anyway, The whole miracle about Badr is wrong. The error began with &quot;Allah caused the rain&quot; itself. He cannot cause it, it just happens. If he caused it, what was he doing in much bigger battles in future? Testing believers?

<dd>Although you do great finding interesting verses/hadiths I have to say this:
</dd>
<dd><i>&quot;Strong errors are long since covered so we have only these.&quot;</i> - then I would rather not weaken the article with less stronger verses. The problem is when people post the article somewhere and someone points out the excuses like I showed, its discouraging for the person who posts the link. Then they have to work through the rebuttal and point out things like you did - many people are not as committed or may not know what to say. If the errors are strong they cannot be refuted in any way and it makes it easy for the other person who posts our link. This page is one of our most popular pages and its critical for it to be a good page. In fact, you see the under construction template at the top. The article needs to be reviewed and fixed so we can get rid of the template. 
</dd>
<dd><i>We can rearange them within their section as I think i said.</i> - sorry I forgot about what you said earlier. So what did you say, how should it be arranged? Lets see how we can do this and keep the stronger errors in one place and the weaker ones in some kind of &quot;misc&quot; section. Should each section have its own Miscellaneous section, or do we collect all of them at the bottom in one section? I'm thinking about the latter.

<li><b>Universe contracting/Heaven is from Smoke:</b> Why talk about galaxys and gas clouds? The verse says earth and heaven were coming together (and talking to Allah). Earth is as old as Galaxies? Nope.
</li>
<li><b>Mountains:</b> i think <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/The_Quran_and_Mountains.html">this</a> is sufficient. They dont stabilize so they are not pegs.
</li>
<li><b>Universe was made in 6 days:</b> It was not made in 6 periods. There are no 6 periods. The best that guy could do was reject the backup hadith of Sahih Muslim.
</li>
<li><b>Seven Planets</b>: rejecting a tafsir that does not support them. The seven planets have names, will add them soon.
</li>
<li><b>Thunder is an Angel:</b> Again rejecting a tafsir. I have added a similar hadith.
</li>
<li><b>Moonlight:</b> Nur never means reflected light. Poor guy wasted so much time. Ibn Kathir is also wrong (that moon light is different from the sun's).
</li>
<li>Rest we have already covered: embryology, geocentric, flat earth.
</li>
<li><b>Sun sets in a Muddy spring:</b> We covered the word meanings. No use of the apologists dictionary, he cherrypicked meanings. Two or three scholars he quoted are utterly flimsy who make more errors defending one. Rest of scholars are tolerable, but still wrong as we have proven in the word analysis. The last part reminds me, do we have articles on hadith authenticity other than the list of fake hadiths?
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I will see how to add all the above, or it could be there already.

<dd>Yes, best to somehow improve the existing information on our side (if needed) or add additional supporting evidence where possible. A small &quot;Responses to Apologetics&quot; section can made for each error below the verse. 
</dd>
<dd>Yes I saw that the blog has rejected the Tafsir. When all else fails they resort to &quot;The Tafsir/hadith is weak&quot;. I'm sure every single hadith can be considered weak if all the chain of narrators are examined.

<dd>By the way that blog link now has some kind of notice saying that the author is going to stop writing responses for now and write better responses later on.

<dd>As for revisions/deletions/additions, we have always improved our work and that's a good thing for any kind of work.

<dd>He also implies that we inserted the &quot;under construction&quot; notice recently or in reaction to his blog's content but we did it in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur%27an&diff=103064&oldid=103063">January</a> (6 months ago) before this blog was noticed and I think it has been on that page before as well.

<p>Hey Guys,
</p><p>I think you have completely misunderstood my recent blog post regarding halting replies to articles written on this site. I will reply to some of the points made:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>&quot;By the way that blog link now has some kind of notice saying that the author is going to stop writing responses for now and write better responses later on. He says (the username is ' .. guy', so) that some of our error sections that he addressed were removed or edited in reaction to his content and I dont think thats true. If he's watching he's most welcome to create a user account and join this discussion.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Over-time you have removed, rewritten alot of the page. Removing many sections that I wrote responses to. Im not claiming this is due to my work solely - I think it is more in relation to you guys realising how weak and lack luster many of the points were on that article.
</p>

<p>Im really unsure where I implied this? After recieving traffic from this page. I realised your discussion regarding the blog. So I checked out the page and found it to have this editing title and noticed large changes to the page. Hence I paid a post detailing I wont be analysing the work until it is 100% finished.
</p><p>Hope this clears up any misunderstanding guys.
</p><p>Also forgive me. I dont know how to correctly post on this site. Feel free to clean it up if you guys can.

<dd>Hi, welcome. You can use colons to indent lines. Indeed over time we have revised (that includes revision/removal/addition) this page a lot to improve it. Its an important page and its a work in progress like everything else on the site. Which sections were removed or edited that had been responded to on your blog?
<dl>
<dd><i>I think it is more in relation to you guys realising how weak and lack luster many of the points were on that article.</i>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Again its a work in progress like any other page and we try to make all the content stronger with time and the reason for that revision can be scrutiny/afterthought that we have ourselves or that closer look may come from outside. Some errors are more obvious than others (this is expected). This dialogue can help us strengthen our page.  --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 18:12, 1 July 2014 (PDT)

<dd> No this is good.

<dl>
<dd>Ok and we look forward to seeing your new revised materials as well.
</dd>
<dd>Have you thought of contacting other Islamic rebuttal websites and starting an apologetics wiki to coordinate the rebuttals? I say this because from my perspective ultimately such an initiative will help our site (in the long run) and for your perspective this is something you would probably want.
</dd>
<dd>Originally I had the idea of having apologetics on our site (for example this article <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an_(Response).html">[27]</a> which is linked at the bottom of the main Errors page) but that idea didnt take off fully and now I think its better to have those things off-site so the apologetics can manage their material any way they want and we can still exchange links. You probably need a good domain name first. --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 01:35, 2 July 2014 (PDT)
<dl>
<dd>Who is on whose side? Lol. It begins with the lies that we made drastic changes in the scientific errors article and put the review notice because of that blog. Barely one or two sentences we added because of it. <a href="wiki/User-Saggy.html" title="User:Saggy">Saggy</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 12:10, 2 July 2014 (PDT)
<dl>
<dd>Competition doesnt scare me and it will motivate people on our side to do even better. We have it very easy already and we dont have the burden of defending Islam.
</dd>
<dd>But indeed the blog's claims are misleading and they do suggest as I mentioned to ThatMuslimGuy before that they are written to make the reader believe we changed/removed stuff in reaction to the blog which is not true. In any case one of the claim made is:
<dl>
<dd>&quot;I recently noticed that WikiIslam has updated there &quot;Scientific Errors Page&quot; with the following:&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>As mentioned we had that notice since a long time and he would have noticed that template even before because he has been writing some rebuttals since a long time (I believe some of his rebuttals are dated a while back). He only created that notice after I mentioned the blog link to you.
</dd>
<dd>The other claim made on the blog is:
<dl>
<dd>&quot;So far they have removed various areas - some of which I addressed.&quot;
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I have asked him twice to tell us what areas we removed or edited and he hasn't responded and until he does that and is specific about which areas/sections/errors he's talking about he cannot make the claim that the areas, some of which he addressed were removed or edited.
</dd>
<dd>So ThatMuslimGuy, can you support your claim by telling us which sections that you addressed on your blog were removed? Here's a link to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur%27an&offset=&limit=250&action=history">page history.</a> You can use the Diff links to go back in time to show you older versions of the page. You can give us Diff links and tell us which sections you're talking about. Here's one example of a Diff link. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur%27an&diff=107485&oldid=107473">Diff</a> link or you can just copy paste the URL(s) here. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Adverse_Effects_of_Islamic_Fasting.html">Happy Ramadan.</a> (a favorite article of mine) --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 15:18, 2 July 2014 (PDT)

<dd> Hey guys, In the past yeah we have thought about doing that. Saggy - Removing multiple points on the site, rewriting sections, adding additions etc - I would say is big change to the article, In my post no where have I asserted you changed the article because of me or anything alike. I simply detailed that I recently checked out the page and that you had added that on the top of the page and removed some points, some of which I had written about, hence rendering those posts on my blog now void.

<dd>I'm thinking at least some of the ones that were removed were added by Saggy (he has been asked by people not to add any errors that arent obvious, hence I made this set of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Talk-Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an.html#.5BSticky.5D_Instructions_for_editing_this_page">guidelines</a> on the talk page). But thats ok, all editors make mistakes (including myself) or may have different perspectives. He's done some good work in finding hadiths and verses and he's passionate and interested about the topic. He made this page on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Hadith.html">Scientific errors in Hadiths</a> (a sample error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Hadith.html#Black_cumin_cures_all_diseases">&quot;black cumin cures everything&quot;</a>), and some other pages. 
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Why dont you try to rebutt some of the more obvious errors such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an.html#Stars_are_Located_in_the_Nearest_Heaven">Stars are Located in the Nearest Heaven</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an.html#Earth_Created_before_Stars">Earth Created before Stars</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an.html#Humans_Created_in_Paradise_and_then_Brought_to_Earth">Humans Created in Paradise and then Brought to Earth</a> which is explored in detail at: <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Creation.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Creation">Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Creation</a> &lt;---- This is a huge glaring Scientific error (evolution). etc. So start with the most difficult errors if you really believe Quran has no errors. Saying they're figures of speech is not a defense.
</dd>
<dd>We'll look at the ones you pointed out and I can assure you they were not removed in reaction to your blog but as we were reviewing them ourselves.

<p>I have to tell you that currently I do not have the time to review your additions. So if they're significant, please add them to your Sandbox pages so they can be reviewed at the same time later on. You can continue doing minor additions where a review doesn't take a long time. If its anything I have to analyze it has to go in the sandbox page. Sorry about that but I just do not currently have the time to review these things one at a time and check if they are accurate or if they have any problems. 
</p><p>Just create as many Sandbox pages as you like so you can organize all your additions. Add notes there where they should be added on the target page etc. Here's <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=Science_and_the_Seven_Earths&diff=107921&oldid=103980">one</a> that you just added.  --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 19:54, 22 June 2014 (PDT)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="72_Virgins">72 Virgins</span></h2>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out what the point of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=72_Virgins&diff=prev&oldid=109201">this</a> edit was, and how it was supposed to be connected to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Talk-72_Jungfrauen.html">this</a> rant by a fly-by anonymous German. The German guy is only complaining about how he thinks the German <i>language</i> in that section is linguistically incorrect. In that case, the German translator should probably be asked to comment or the talk page should be deleted (if they have no intention of fixing the alleged problem, then their complaint is nothing more than a rant). Instead you make some linguistically incorrect additions of your own to the English version and claim &quot;I corrected the English side&quot;? Really? The point of that western dhimmi author is that the Bible does not claim that after death Christians will be issued with wings and a harp, and walk on clouds, just like how she wants us to believe the Qur'an does not claim that after death Muslims will be issued with virgins. Our point is her analogy is faulty because the Qur'an <i>does</i> state that after death Muslims will be issued with virgins. Since Revelation 14:2 does not state anywhere that Christians will be issued with wings and a harp, and walk on clouds, the addition was pointless and is counter-productive to the purpose of the article. The probable origin of ideas is irrelevant information and only serves to water-down and confuse the articulated and concise approach of the article. Your other edit to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=Revelational_Circumstances_of_the_Qur%27an%3A_Missing_Verses&diff=109206&oldid=109200">Revelational Circumstances of the Qur'an</a> was also faulty, in that Tabari is not a part of &quot;the major Hadith collections&quot; (all other sources such as tafsirs etc., were purposely excluded by Sani because they are not as authoritative as the major Hadith collections and tend to contain apologetic opinions). The fact that this series only quotes major Hadith collections is stated quite clearly on its main page, but you seem to be making additions without fully understanding why or what you are editing. Please can you explain your edits or at least try to be more careful in the future. <a href="wiki/User-Sahab.html" title="User:Sahab">--Sahab</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Sahab.html" title="User talk:Sahab">talk</a>) 02:27, 11 August 2014 (PDT)

<dd>The woman overlooked that Quran makes the claim but Bible does not. The image of a heavener with a harp is at best a pop culture thing derived from that verse. The sentence is still too weird. <a href="wiki/User-Saggy.html" title="User:Saggy">Saggy</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong>) 06:48, 11 August 2014 (PDT)
<dl>
<dd>She did not overlook it. That was exactly her point. She is claiming Muslims view the idea of virgins in heaven much the same as Christians view wings and a harp i.e. it's a made-up thing that no practising Christian actually believes. Okay, so you think that sentence is &quot;weird&quot;, but that does not explain why you think adding pointless trivia to the page is &quot;fixing it&quot;, nor does it explain why you think your edit made it less &quot;weird&quot; (if it wasn't linguistically weird to begin with, it certainly was afterwards). We are not contesting her claim that the wings and harp thing is a myth because she is right, so there is nothing more needed to be said about that. What we are doing is pointing out <i>how</i> she is wrong.<a href="wiki/User-Sahab.html" title="User:Sahab">--Sahab</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Sahab.html" title="User talk:Sahab">talk</a>) 07:22, 11 August 2014 (PDT)

<dd> The site's quality is the first priority and must be preserved (so it doesn't matter who the boss is   - we are all bosses and it depends whose arguments makes sense). I am a nobody too just like you and I will consult with Sahab to decide on this. Looking at it rationally, the problem is that I don't have time to review a regular editor's edits every time and many of yours edits need to be seriously corrected and require a lot of time for correction. If all of someone's edits require serious evaluation it wouldnt be a problem unless there was someone willing to evaluate the edits who had the time to do it.
</dd>
<dd><i>&quot;He did it in large numbers.&quot;</i> - what large numbers? The hadith only say &quot;many camels&quot;. Many camels could be 6, 10, 15, 30 -- we dont know. So what do you mean by large numbers and how do you prove it? If there were a large number of people to feed, 20 camels could be slaughtered and that would be considered &quot;many&quot; or &quot;large numbers&quot;.
</dd>
<dd>No as I said, the Tafsir quote has nothing specific to do with Cosmology; nothing about Stars, skies, universe etc. It leaves one wondering what it has to do with cosmology. <i>&quot;Often this cosmology and creation are seen to have some things&quot;</i> - this is your interpretation. If creationism is linked we can then copy all the Creation hadiths into Cosmology which doesnt make any sense. I will wait for Sahab's input before commenting further. --<a href="wiki/User-Axius.html" title="User:Axius">Axius</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a href="wiki/User_talk-Axius.html" title="User talk:Axius">talk</a> | <a href="wiki/Special-Contributions/Axius.html" title="Special:Contributions/Axius">contribs</a>)</span> 04:51, 15 August 2014 (PDT)

<dd>I think the edit Saggy made to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="w/index.php.html?title=Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Animals&diff=prev&oldid=109252#Sacrifices">Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Animals</a> is a very good addition to the page. Ritual slaughter is described in all Abrahamic texts, but there are several differences here in comparison to the other two big faiths:

<dd>1. Concerning Christians, they do not perform ritual slaughter, nor did Jesus ever perform a ritual slaughter. 
</dd>
<dd>2. Concerning Jews, yes they do perform ritual slaughter, but they do not go around telling people that Moses loved animals and that he is an excellent role-model for today's socially conscientious youth. 
</dd>
<dd>3. On the other hand, a lot of apologists do try to convert young people to Islam by trying to sell the idea that Muhammad was a progressive man who loved animals.

<dd>I also agree with Saggy that the &quot;kindness to animals&quot; hadith do not fit in with that page. I certainly did not add them and I do not think they should remain. A section like that does not belong on a wiki critical of Islam. If it was added with the intention of making the wiki appear more &quot;neutral&quot; then I can safely say that it will <i>never</i> convince anyone that the wiki is neutral, but it does make the page look odd and will probably confuse people.

Or at the very least, keep it on the cosmology page but trim it down to only include the relevant information (e.g., as Saggy noted, &quot;Some uterus is attached to that throne. It will react on Judgement Day and so on.&quot;).

<dd>About the triangular brackets; I'm guessing they are there because Saggy copy/pasted text from Answering Islam. This is a concern to me. The last time we had an editor who got carried away with copy/pasting stuff from there, things didn't turn out so well (It was this by OsmanHassan that left us with those Errors pages in such a mess). If you are not going to bother removing the emphasis added by the Answering Islam team (such as brackets, underlining and caps) you really should not be using them.

<dd>Another concern is the fact that the tafsir is not being cited properly. <i>Ibn Kathir, &quot;Interpretation of Qur'an 47:22&quot;</i> is not a reference. If an online version of Tafsir Ibn Kathir is going to quoted, then it should be cited more like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Creation.html#Ibn_Kathir_2">this</a> (Not exactly an up-to-date example of a reference because it does not use any CiteWeb templates. Nevertheless, notice the archived URL and the actual heading of each section provided in the tafsir being quoted).

<dd>At Saggy: What does &quot;I know what he's likely to say&quot; mean? Honestly, I would really like to know what you think you know, because I highly doubt you know what I'm going to say. I'll admit I usually think you edits should be removed. But that is because they are usually terrible. In this case, they are not wholly terrible (in the first case, it was actually a good addition and a good observation concerning the &quot;Kindness&quot; hadith). <a href="wiki/User-Sahab.html" title="User:Sahab">--Sahab</a> (<a href="wiki/User_talk-Sahab.html" title="User talk:Sahab">talk</a>) 03:51, 16 August 2014 (PDT)

<dd>Ok. I added back the Sacrifice hadiths and took out the kindness section. Maybe those reasons could be added to those sections (just a suggestion). Thanks for the analysis. I agree care should be taken if copying stuff from Answering-Islam.
</dd>
<dd>Saggy, you can move the Cosmology stuff to the temp page as directed by Sahab or trim it down as suggested.

<dd>Well guys I dont know if I can keep up with the edit reviews but I'll try my best. I had suggested to Saggy that he should keep his edits in his Sandbox pages and maybe one day we can find someone willing who has the time to review them.

<dd>No probs. I don't think any additional text would be needed. As it is, it lets the readers know that Mo had no problems with animal slaughter without making judgements on it or bringing up other faiths. If we did bring up other faiths, then it would look like we're defending them (just think of Natassia and the problems her writings have caused on the wiki recently).

<dd>Sahab also said to you <i>&quot;I usually think you[r] edits should be removed.

So I'm sorry but from now please only edit Sandboxes in your userspace (no main space edits, or edits on Sandboxes for the site). You can edit your Sandboxes in any way you like and organize your content in whatever way you like and you can also make new pages in your Sandboxes.

<dd><i>&quot;What am I going to do with a sandbox out of this site?&quot;</i> - what do you mean by this?
