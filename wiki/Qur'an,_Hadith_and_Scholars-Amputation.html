Furthermore, Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and the early generations of Muslims had no qualms with it being so.

<div class="quotes">Yahya related to me from Malik that Abu'z-Zinad informed him that a governor of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz took some people in battle and had not killed any of them. He wanted to cut off their hands or kill them, so he wrote to Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz about that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz wrote to him, &quot;Better to take less than that.&quot;
<p>Yahya said that he heard Malik say, &quot;What is done among us about a person who steals the goods of people which are placed under guard in the markets, and their owners put them in their containers and store them together is that if anyone steals any of that from where it is kept, and its value reaches that for which cutting off the hand is obliged, his hand must be cut off, whether or not the owner of the goods is with his goods and whether it is night or day.&quot;
</p><p>Malik said about some one who stole something for which cutting off the hand was obliged and then what he stole was found with him and he returned it to its owner, &quot;His hand is cut off.&quot;
</p><p>Malik said, &quot;If someon says, 'How can his hand be cut off when the goods have been taken from him and returned to their owner?', it is because he is in the same position as the wine drinker when the smell of the wine is found on his breath and he is not drunk. He is flogged with the hadd.
</p>
&quot;The hadd is imposed for drinking wine even if it does not make the man intoxicated. That is because he drank it to become intoxicated. It is the same as that with cutting off the hand of the thief for theft when it is taken from him, even if he has not profited from it and it was returned to its owner. When he stole it, he stole it to take it away.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Al-Muwatta</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muwatta/041-mmt.php#041.41.10.31b#041.41.10.31b">41 10.31b</a></div></div>

<p>Amra continued, &quot;The slave took it and unstitched it and took out the cloak. In its place, he put some felt or skin and sewed it up again. When the mawla girls came to Madina, they gave it to his people. When they opened it, they found felt in it and did not find the cloak.

Malik said, &quot;The limit I prefer above which cutting off the hand is obliged is three dirhams, whether the exchange is high or low.

<div class="quotes">Yahya related to me from Malik from Abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Qasim from his father that a man from Yemen who had his hand and foot cut off came and went before Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and complained to him that the governor of the Yemen had wronged him, and the man used to pray part of the night. Abu Bakr said, &quot;By your father, your night is not the night of a thief.&quot; Then they missed a necklace of Asma bint Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq. The man came to go around with them looking for it. He said, &quot;O Allah! You are responsible for the one who invaded the people of this good house by night!&quot; They found the jewelry with a goldsmith. He claimed that the maimed man had brought it to him. The maimed man confessed or it was testified against him. Abu Bakr as-Siddiq ordered that his left hand be cut off. Abu Bakr said, &quot;By Allah! His dua against himself is more serious, as far as I am concerned, than his theft.&quot;
Yahya said that Malik said, &quot;What is done among us about the person who steals several times and is then called to reckoning, is that only his hand is cut off for all he stole when the hadd has not been applied againsthim. If the hadd has been applied against him before that, and he steals what obliges cutting off, then the next limb is cut off.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Al-Muwatta</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muwatta/041-mmt.php#041.41.10.30b#041.41.10.30b">41 10.30b</a></div></div>

<div class="quotes">(But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds, then verily, Allah will pardon him. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) Therefore, whoever repents and goes back to Allah after he commits theft, then Allah will forgive him. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that a woman committed theft during the time of the Messenger of Allah and those from whom she stole brought her and said, &quot;O Allah's Messenger! This woman stole from us.<i> Her people said, &quot;We ransom her.&quot; The Messenger of Allah said,</i>
<p>(Cut off her hand.) They said, &quot;We ransom her with five hundred Dinars.&quot; The Prophet said,
</p><p>(Cut off her hand.) Her right hand was cut off and the woman asked, &quot;O Messenger of Allah! Is there a chance for me to repent&quot; He said,
</p><p>(Yes. This day, you are free from your sin just as the day your mother gave birth to you.) Allah sent down the verse in Surat Al-Ma'idah,
</p><p>(But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then verily, Allah will pardon him. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This woman was from the tribe of Makhzum. Her story was narrated in the Two Sahihs from Az-Zuhri from `Urwah from `A'ishah, The incident caused concern for the Quraysh after she committed the theft during the time of the battle of the Conquest [of Makkah]. They said, &quot;Who can talk to Allah's Messenger about her matter&quot; They then said, &quot;Who dares speak to him about such matters other than Usamah bin Zayd, his loved one.&quot; When the woman was brought to the Messenger of Allah , Usamah bin Zayd talked to him about her and the face of the Messenger changed color (because of anger) and he said,
</p><p>(Do you intercede in a punishment prescribed by Allah) Usamah said to him, &quot;Ask Allah to forgive me, O Allah's Messenger!&quot; During that night, the Messenger of Allah stood up and gave a speech and praised Allah as He deserves to be praised. He then said,
</p>
(Those who were before you were destroyed because when an honorable person among them would steal, they would leave him. But, when a weak man among them stole, they implemented the prescribed punishment against him. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! If Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad stole, I will have her hand cut off.) The Prophet commanded that the hand of the woman who stole be cut off, and it was cut off.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=5&tid=13843?sid=5&tid=13843">Repentance of the Thief is Acceptable</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Where_should_amputated_limbs_be_buried.3F">Where should amputated limbs be buried?</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allaah. 
<p>This matter is open, because amputated limbs do not come under the same ruling as the whole person. There is no reason why they should not be put with the garbage, but burying them in the ground out of respect towards them is preferable. But the matter is open, praise be to Allaah, as we said. They do not have to be washed (ghusl) and buried unless it is a foetus of more than four months’ gestation. But if it was merely flesh into which the soul had not yet been breathed, or it was an amputated finger or something similar, then the matter is open. But burying it in the ground is good and is preferable.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Can_a_thief_have_his_hand_surgically_reattached.3F">Can a thief have his hand surgically reattached?</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allaah.   
<p>The thief has no right to have the amputated hand reattached, because that means that the signs of the punishment for his crime disappear, and the effectiveness of the rebuke and lesson is lost. It is contrary to the idea of punishment and example as mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
</p><p>“And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah. And Allaah is All‑Powerful, All‑Wise”
[al-Maa'idah 5:38]
