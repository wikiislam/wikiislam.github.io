<p>The Qur'an makes the following statement:
</p><p><i>&quot;Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it had been from [any] other than Allah , they would have found within it much contradiction.&quot; [Qur'an, 4:82]</i>
</p><p>Thus it opens itself up for examination. And challenges the reader to try to disprove it by finding any contradictions within in.
</p><p>There have been attempts to do so. This article is a response to one such attempt. 
</p><p>My intention is to clarify these matters. Any errors within this article are my own.
</p><p>&quot;Do not be diverted therefrom by those who do not believe in it - those who pursue their own opinions - lest you fall.&quot; 20:16

<p>It's not a contradiction at all to say that a drink is made of sugar,water and tea. Simlarly no contradiction in saying that man is made of water,bone and dust. It is a <b>contradistinction</b>.
</p><p>So what ARE we made of? That depends on who you ask.
</p><p>If you ask an anatomist they will say: &quot;organs, muscles, vessels, and bone.&quot;
</p><p>A chemist will say: &quot;Elements - Mainly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen), or Compounds - Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and WATER. 
</p><p>An astrophysicist will say: &quot;From the EARTH, which it itself made of Star DUST. And before this everything came from a single incredibly dense particle, And before that there was NOTHING.&quot; 
</p><p>An Embryologist will tell you: &quot;Part of the SPERM, which develops in the female to produce an embryo which at one stage resembles a blood CLOT.&quot;
</p><p>Which of them is wrong? They are all right on different levels.
</p><p>And whilst a pure evolutionist will say that Mankind simply became as a result of randomness and chance, the Qur’an say they were created, with God’s own design, by his power. 
</p><p>You are trying to disprove the Qur'an, but instead all you are doing is proving its veracity. Why do you not read the verses again, perhaps you will find yourself addressed therein: <i>open disputer', and 'will you not then believe'?</i>

<p>Are you disagreeing because you know better? Did you not also claim that a person can't be made from
sperm and out of water? Contradistinction, not contradiction. 
</p><p>As you have never seen or studied a Jinn, how would you know how what it is or isn't made of? If it is on the basis
that water put fire out, then that is assuming that the fire is the same as what you are familiar with. But already we
are told that it is a smokeless fire.
</p><p>Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. It is possible that it can be set on fire, and experiments have demonstrated this.
</p><p>If the hydrogen were released, the resulting flame would be smokeless because there is no source of carbon to create soot.
</p><p>As for the every living thing is created of water, no one knew that for sure in the days of the Qur'ans revelation. But
today science confirms it. The cytoplasm of the cell is made up of around 80% water, and most organisms consist of 50-90% water
in their body compositions. The Human body is about 70% water in total if you include the bones; and around 90% if you only consider
the tissue.
</p><p>The fact that the Qur'an has said this 1400 years ago is a sign in itself that we can confirm. So if it also talks about 
another creation that we are not so familiar with, why should we feel the need to deny it?

<p>There is nothing in the verse that indicates it is limited to these numbers of wings. And quoting a hadith to contradict the Qur’an? The title of contradictions in the Qur’an would lead a person to believe that you would show contradictions within text of the Qur’an itself. 
</p><p>But in any case, the answer to your &quot;contradiction&quot; is within the text of the very verse itself, in the next clause. &quot;He multiplies/increases/adds to in creation whatever He wills.&quot;
</p><p>Therefore, Yes angels do have 2,3 or 4 wings but there is no restriction on what God decides to create. It is up to him to add or
take away from whatsoever He chooses.

<p>Those that wish to believe, are worthy to have their heart open to belief. But those who do not wish it, will remain clouded in doubt and obscurity, because they themselves are averse to the truth, they will be made to dislike it (further). 
</p><p>Consider a lamp. When the person want light, the lamp will shine upon them. But if they turn away, the light will be turned away from them. It is only when they themselves really want to find the light by actually turning towards it, will it be turned towards them. Therefore there is free will.
</p><p>Some people make the mistake of confusing the concept of predestination with free will. 
</p><p>No one except for God has absolute free will. Every that is created exists within the limits and constraints of the abilities and 
universe that He has created for them. Predestination is regarding things that a person cannot change; in what year and family they are
born into, nationality, genetic make up etc. Free will is the choices that a person is allowed to make. 
</p><p>It is like sitting an exam question consisting of four choices. You can't choose the number of questions, the instrument i.e. pencil
that you use to fill it in, where you sit the exam and when, but you have free will in choosing the correct answer instead of 
the wrong answers.

<p>The resurrection of mankind will be a bodily one. To the extent that even the fingertips will be recreated. Here’s a question for you: how would a man in Arabia during a time of ignorance, know that every human being has unique fingerprints? Because that is what is being alluded to in this verse.
</p><p>Now as for the soul, upon death it is separated from the body, until the day of resurrection where it will be reunited with the body that has been remade. 
</p><p>When God refers to a individual he may refer to their soul, as that is the actual part of that has free will, does good or evil, and is thereby worthy of reward or punishment. 
The righteous soul will be at peace, whilst the unjust will be in distress for their misdeeds. But both will have bodies through which they will given what they earned.
</p><p>If you say that such and such a number of &quot;poor souls died&quot;, do you mean that their bodies are still alive? Or is it merely a reference to them as beings?

</p><p>“And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge)” [Qaaf 50:16] 
</p><p>&quot;- most of the mufassireen said that what is meant is that He is near by means of His angels whose task it is to record people’s deeds. And those who said that it means that He is near explained it as meaning that He is near by His knowledge, as is said concerning how He is with us.&quot; -  Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://islam-qa.com/en/ref/11035">[1]</a>. 
</p><p>This same explanation can be applied to [Baqarah 2:186]. Allah is near to us in Knowledge. This does not contradict the fact that He rose over His Throne in a manner befitting to Him and that His Throne is above the water (not the ocean, as the 'accusation' implies, since Allah is above the Heavens and this world is certainly not above the Heavens).

<p>Intercession is not possible for anyone except for those whom permission has been granted. This can be seen from various verses, such as the mentioned 20:109 .
</p><p>However, not everyone can benefit from this intercession, how will those who are disbelievers benefit in the hereafter from intercession, if in their worldly life they did not benefit from the warning?  Thus in  the verses that say there will be no 
intercession it is seen that they are addressing those that reject faith. 
</p><p>Intercession is only for the believers.
</p><p>And do not consider every hadith regarding intercession as being authentic. Particularly if your article regards so called contradictions in the Qur’an.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Extended_Response">Extended Response</span></h3>
<p>There have been well known stories of a lost city named Ubar since Ancient times by the  bedouin arabs. This was thought to be only a myth, but in 1990, 12 metres below the sands was uncovered a city.  Prior to this, the only evidence for its existence would have been from space. This city was found to be full of tall towers or pillars - its distintive feature.
What is interesting is how the Qur'an describes a city:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad (people), Of the (city of) Iram, with lofty pillars, The like of which were not produced in (all) the land? <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/089-qmt.php#089.006-8#089.006-8">89:6-8</a></div></div>
<p>A city of lofty pillars? Could this be the very same as what was called Ubar? But no historian had ever heard of this city as it could not be found anywhere on record, so IRAM was thought to be nonexistent. That is until the 4300 year old city of Ebla was excavated in Syria. Within its library was a record of all the cities which it had traded with. Iram was one of those mentioned. 
</p><p>So the Qur’an mentions a city which no one knew existed, with its distincitive features by any otherwise unknown name and describes that they were destroyed – and you are contending with its description of how they were destroyed and calling it contradictory!? 
</p><p>And it describes how the Prophet Hud who was sent to the people of Ad warned them. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Now fear Allah, and obey me. Yea, fear Him Who has bestowed on you freely all that ye know. Freely has He bestowed on you cattle and sons,- And Gardens and Springs. Truly I fear for you the Penalty of a Great Day. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/042-qmt.php#042.00131-135#042.00131-135">42:131-135</a></div></div>
<p>Today the region in which this city was found is arid and dry desrt, but the Qur’an talks about it having gardens and springs? In fact, it was found that the area had once been full of cultivable fertile  green land, (although there was still desert)
but climate change had caused it to become as it is now.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<div class="quotes">The 'Ad (people) (too) rejected (Truth): then how terrible was My Penalty and My Warning? For We sent against them a furious wind, on a Day of violent Disaster, Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up (from the ground). <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/018-qmt.php#018.020#018.020">18:20</a></div></div>

</p>
<div class="quotes">And the 'Ad, they were destroyed by a furious Wind, exceedingly violent. He made it rage against them seven nights and eight days in succession: so that thou couldst see the (whole) people lying prostrate in its (path), as they had been roots of hollow palm-trees tumbled down! <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/069-qmt.php#069.006-7#069.006-7">69:6-7</a></div></div>
<p>From this we can infer that the Ad were destroyed by a destructive wind, such as a cyclone.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Then, when they saw the (Penalty in the shape of) a cloud traversing the sky, coming to meet their valleys, they said, “This cloud will give us rain!”. Nay, it is the (Calamity) ye were asking to be hastened!- A wind wherein is a Grievous Penalty! <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/046-qmt.php#046.024#046.024">46:24</a></div></div>
<p>According to the Qur’an, the people of Ad, did not recognise their calamity even as it was approaching them. They mistook it for a cloud full of rain. 
</p><p>“The first sign (of a dust or sandstorm) is an approaching wall of dust-laden air which may be several thousand feet in height lifted by the strong rising currents and stirred by a fairly strong wind.” Brian Doe, Southern Arabia, Thames and Hudson, 1971, p. 21}}
</p><p>A cyclone in the desert that draws up a lot of sand as it passes, can therefore resemble a rain cloud from a distance. 	
The French magazine, Ça M’Interesse states the same as follows “Ubar was buried under a sand of 12 meters thickness as a result of a storm”( Ça M’Interesse, January 1993 )
</p><p>The Qur’an already 1400 years ago spoke of all this.  So the location,  name, description and    manner of destruction – from its approach to its start is all correct. But you are disputing the duration?
Well that is simple enough to see from the verses. It was sent on one day – which was described a s a day of furious disaster, throwing people as if they were uprooted trees. The consequence that would be expected if a cyclone were to rage through a built up area. 
</p><p>Then in another place it says that it raged for 7 nights and eight days one after the other. From that you can deduce it was sent 
in the daytime of the first day and ended before the night of the last day. 
But in saying that the cyclone was sent on a day that resulted in destruction, there is no limiting it to remain there for just the one day. It as the Qur’an goes on to explain, raged for a number of days.
</p><p>Therefore there is  no contradiction in this story. Only signs for whoever wishes to accept them.

<p>Meaning that whatever you may call a son, would be his own creation, just as everything is, so why do you call anyone a son? 
If anyone is, everyone is, and it is better that you do not call anyone at all, because then you would begin on the path of deifying people and raising them to the rank of godhood, and making them into partners. 
</p><p>In what way could you claim that God has a son, when he is not like us nor does he have any partner. Everything is only

<p>You should be aware that the verse 11:70 refers to angels who have been sent to give them the message of the birth of Isaac to the Prophet Ibrahim, whereas the first verse (25:20) refers to human messengers who were Prophets, not angels.  This is clear from the very next verse which states:
</p>
<div class="quotes">And those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, &quot;Why were not angels sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our Lord?&quot; They have certainly become arrogant within themselves and [become] insolent with great insolence. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/025-qmt.php#025.021#025.021">25:21</a></div></div>
<p>Had verse 25:20, referred to angels as well, people would not have made the objection. 
It can be seen from history that that instance of this verse’s revelation was their objection that why has a messenger who eats food and walks in the markets, been sent to us? Why has an angel not been sent instead?

<p>It does not so much as even imply that the pharaoh was not killed. 
</p><p>You have quoted verses 10:90-2, claiming that they suggest that the pharaoh was not killed. Let us assess your claim.
“When the flood over took him.”  - so we was just about to be drowned, when he said okay I submit now. But an apology is meaningless when he can see that he is about to be destroyed. So he was told that his body would be preserved and thus be a sign for those who came after him, to see what was the end of the rejecters.
</p><p>You can see the pharaoh’s body in the museum. So the prophecy of the Qur’an has come true. How would a man in a time of ignorance know this?
</p><p>If what you are trying to suggest is that by his body being preserved it means that he will be kept alive, you are really stretching it.

</p><p><i>And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out wholesome drink and food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise</i>
Qur'an 16:67
</p><p>Firstly for the verse 16:67 look at the other translatons:
</p>
<div class="quotes">PICKTHAL: And of the fruits of the date-palm, and grapes, whence ye derive strong drink and (also) good nourishment. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense. 
SHAKIR: And of the fruits of the palms and the grapes-- you obtain from them intoxication and goodly provision; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who ponder. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/016-qmt.php#016.007#016.007">16:7</a></div></div>
<p>It is only the translator YusufAli who calls it &quot;wholesome drink&quot;.
</p><p>This verse was revealed before it was prohibited. But through it God is telling people something. That is why he is saying there's a sign in that for those who have sense/ponder.It showing that from the same source, you can get strong drink OR good nourishment. The first is therefore not good nourishment.
</p><p>And all you have done is show how the revelation concerning alcohol came in stages. In the first instance it was put in a verse making a distinction between it (as an intoxicant) and the goodly provision which is also from the same source. So you realise it is not a goodly provision.
</p><p>Then the believers are told not to pray whilst intoxicated, because then they will not be able to understand what they are saying. Effectively this will prevent them from drinking in the first place, because they have to pray at five times a day, at least, and intoxication may last for a long duration of time. Next they are told that although there is some benefit in it, the harm outweighs the benefit. In the final instance, once people’s minds have been prepared sufficiently and they have been properly weaned off alcohol, they are told that it is from Satan, and that they should leave it aside so that they can be successful. As it is impure, and only the pure are successful.
</p><p>So where is the contradiction? Remember these are a series of revelations. 
</p><p>Things were prohibited and duties were given stage by stage, so that people would not feel burdened by it. Do you notice how the first thing they were called towards was Acceptance of the unity of God, and thereafter the Prophethood? At the start there was no mention of fasting, pilgrimage, paying the poor rate or prayer. These were encouraged as they had passed the previous stage. This was to make things easy, not difficult. Otherwise the whole Qur'an could have been revealed in one instant.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Response_46">Response</span></h3>
<p>The Qur'an is the guiding text which explain the general principles of things. However, it is the Apostle's duty to explain the
finer details. This can be seen with Prayer for example. The Qur'an stresses the importance of prayer, but doesn't give the exact
details of it. However, it points towards obedience to the Prophet and following what is revealed to him for guidance in all matters.
</p><p>So in the case of inheritance the general principles are mentioned, but as there are a great many potential cases which may arise,
they are not all covered under these. The hadith give further information about what to do in other cases.
</p><p>The example you provided is already well known. 
</p><p><br>
</p><p>&quot;Imam Ali ibn Abi Taleb (as) was once interrupted while he was delivering a sermon from the pulpit by someone who asked him how to distribute the inheritance of someone who had died leaving a wife, his parents and two daughters. Imam Ali ibn Abi Taleb (as) instantly answered:
</p><p>&quot;The wife's share becomes one ninth.&quot;
</p><p>How?
</p><p>This answer is in fact the result of a long analysis with a number of steps. Ordinarily, we have to decide on the original share of each of these heirs, in the following way:
</p><p>The wife takes one eighth, in view of the presence of an inheriting child. [Noble Qur'an, 4:12]
The deceased's father and mother take one sixth each. [Noble Qur'an, 4:11]
The two daughters take two thirds of the inheritance. [Noble Qur'an, 4:11]
So the total will be:
1/8 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 2/3 = 3/24 + 4/24 + 4/24 + 16/24 = 27/24
</p><p>This means the share becomes less than 1/8 in view of the increase of the total of the shares which are so fixed and prescribed. So the one eighth, the original share due to the wife out of twenty-four total shares, has become three shares out of a total of twenty-seven, which is one ninth.&quot;  
</p><p><br>
</p><p>Therefore, it is not a lack of mathematical knowledge in the Qur'an, but in the one who does not know how to apply it.
</p><p>If you disagree, consider how many cases and situations it covers. There is great wisdom behind the apportioned amounts for
each category of inheritor, if you care to delve into it.
