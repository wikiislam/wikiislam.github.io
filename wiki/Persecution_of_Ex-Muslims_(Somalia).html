<div class="quotes">The report states the gunman shot Ali in the back Sept. 7 after he refused to join a crowd chanting Quran verses in honor of the lunar eclipse. Solar and lunar eclipses are significant in Islam and are accompanied by special congregational prayers. The Union of Islamic Courts confiscated Ali's body for 24 hours before delivering it to the grieving family, the report said.<br>. . .<br>
<p>The group reports that in July there were unconfirmed reports three Christians had been shot and killed by Islamists as they returned home from a prayer meeting. 
</p><p>In October 2005, an evangelist and house church leader, Osman Sheik Ahmed, was shot dead by Islamist radicals, Barnabas said. Also, children of Christian Somali refugees in Kenya have been kidnapped by Muslim relatives and taken to Islamic institutions in Somalia for 'rehabilitation.'&quot; 
</p><p>The Barnabas Fund pointed out the leader of the Union of Islamic Courts, Hassan Dahir Aweys, promised to implement Sharia, or Islamic law, in all areas he controls. 
</p>
According to Sharia, the group explained, apostates – those who leave Islam for another religion – must be killed. Union of Islamic Court leaders even have threatened to kill as apostates Muslims who are lax in their prayers, claiming this is commanded by Sharia. Several Muslims have been flogged publicly for drug-related offences since the union took control.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=52004?ARTICLE_ID=52004">Convert from Islam to Christianity killed</a><br>Michael Ireland, Assist News Service, September 16, 2006</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Mr Ali was shot in the chest outside the Hiran community education project school, in Beledweyne in central Somalia on Sunday.
<p>He was murdered alongside fellow Brit Rehena Ahmed, aged 32 and two Kentan teachers in a raid by al Shahaab militants.
</p><p>The 64-year-old dad-of-two, the son of poor nomads from Beledweyne, had moved to Britain in 1967 after winning a scholarship to study.
</p><p>He worked as a teacher and later as an educational psychologist for Birmingham City Council.
</p><p>He made regular trips back to Somalia and in 2004 decided to brave the dangers of his homeland and returned to Beledweyne to set up the school.
</p><p>Mrs Ali, aged 64, said: &quot;The school he established is run in a house which is also where he lived.
</p><p>&quot;There are various disgruntled factions running around and because he was a convert to Christianity from Islam, then he was a target.
</p><p>&quot;They raided the house in the middle of the night and murdered all four people there.&quot;
</p><p>&quot;I will continue to pray for the people of Somalia and eventually some good may come out of this.&quot;
</p><p>His son Robleh Tinning, aged 32, said: &quot;He wasn't trying to convert anyone, he was just trying to teach English. He always had a grand project on the go.
</p><p>&quot;If something needs doing, someone has to stand up and say they are going to do it and that is what he did. He was a doer, not a moaner.&quot;
</p>
Mr Ali kept a blog on the development of the school and had detailed his fears about night-time raids by militants.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-headteacher-daud-hassan-ali-61743">&quot;Birmingham headteacher Daud Hassan Ali is shot dead in Somalia&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fbirmingham-headteacher-daud-hassan-ali-61743&date=2013-10-25?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fbirmingham-headteacher-daud-hassan-ali-61743&date=2013-10-25">archived</a>)</span><br> Birmingham Mail, April 15, 2008<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-headteacher-daud-hassan-ali-61743">http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/birmingham-headteacher-daud-hassan-ali-61743</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Birmingham+headteacher+Daud+Hassan+Ali+is+shot+dead+in+Somalia&rft.atitle=&rft.date=April+15%2C+2008&rft.pub=Birmingham+Mail&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Flocal-news%2Fbirmingham-headteacher-daud-hassan-ali-61743&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Ex-Muslims_(Somalia)"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
<div class="quotes">For [ex-Muslims like] Sophia and Hakan, a lot of the prejudice they faced seemed to be borne out of cultural ideas, which are particularly ingrained in the South Asian community relating to notions of family honour.
<p>But it's too easy to say this is just a cultural problem. Dig a little deeper and you find that there is a theological argument which advocates the death penalty for apostates, which has serious implications for British society.
</p><p>Last week, British teacher Daud Hassan Ali, 64, was shot dead in Somalia. His widow, Margaret Ali, said her husband was targeted by Islamists who &quot;believe it is ok to kill any man who was born into Islam and left the faith&quot;.

<div class="quotes"> Among at least 24 aid workers killed in Somalia this year was one who was beheaded last month specifically for converting from Islam to Christianity, among other charges, according to an eyewitness.
<p>Muslim extremists from the al Shabab group fighting the transitional government on Sept. 23 sliced the head off of Mansuur Mohammed, 25, a World Food Program (WFP) worker, before horrified onlookers of Manyafulka village, 10 kilometers (six miles) from Baidoa.
</p><p>The militants had intercepted Mohammed and a WFP driver, who managed to escape, earlier in the morning. Sources close to Mohammed’s family said he converted from Islam to Christianity in 2005.
</p><p>The eyewitness, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said the militants that afternoon gathered the villagers of Manyafulka, telling them that they would prepare a feast for them. The people gathered anticipating the slaughter of a sheep, goat or camel according to local custom.
</p><p>Five masked men emerged carrying guns, wielding Somali swords and dragging the handcuffed Mohammed. One pulled back Mohammed’s head, exposing his face as he scraped his sword against his short hair as if to sharpen it. Another recited the Quran as he proclaimed that Mohammed was a “murtid,” an Arabic term for one who converts from Islam to Christianity. The Muslim militant announced that Mohammed was an infidel and a spy for occupying Ethiopian soldiers.
</p><p>Mohammed remained calm with an expressionless face, never uttering a word, said the eyewitness. As the chanting of “Allah Akubar [God is greater]” rose to a crescendo, one of the militiamen twisted his head, allowing the other to slit his neck. When the head was finally severed from the torso, the killers cheered as they displayed it to the petrified crowd.
</p><p>The militants allowed one of their accomplices to take a video of the slaughter using a mobile phone. The video was later circulated secretly and sold in Somalia and in neighboring countries in what many see as a strategy to instill fear among those contemplating conversion from Islam to Christianity.
</p>
Unconfirmed reports indicated that a similar incident took place in Lower Juba province of Somalia in July, when Christians found with Bibles were publicly executed. Their families fled to Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya, and such killings are forcing other Christians to flee to neighboring Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.christianpersecution.info/news/somalia-christian-aid-workers-beheaded-for-converting-from-islam-16822/">Somalia: Christian Aid Workers Beheaded for Converting from Islam</a><br>Compass Direct, October 28, 2008</div></div>

<div class="quotes">A Somali Christian put in a refugee camp police cell here for defending his family against Islamic zealots has been released after Christians helped raise the 20,000 Kenya shilling fine (US$266) that a camp “court” demanded for his conversion dishonoring Islam and its prophet, Muhammad. 
<p>But for Salat Sekondo Mberwa of Mogadishu, the war-torn capital of Somalia, this was not the highest price he has had to pay for leaving Islam. A few weeks ago Muslim zealots shot Mberwa in the shoulder and left him for dead, and he and other refugees told of hired Muslim gangs in Somalia raping and killing converts, denying them access to water and, in the refugee camp, burning their homes.<br>. . .<br>
They arrested Mberwa and detained him at a camp police cell. After his release, Mberwa said, he was resting inside his house on Nov. 26 at around 6 p.m. when he heard people shouting his name and swearing to “teach him a lesson” for embarrassing them by having left Islam. Once again he decided to lock himself in, and as before the attackers forced their way in. 
</p><p>“I was trying to escape through the window when one of them fired a gun, but the bullet narrowly missed me,” he told Compass. “Then I heard another gun fire, and I felt a sharp pain on my left shoulder. I fell down. Thinking that I was dead, they left.” immediately arrived and gave first aid to the bleeding Mberwa. They arranged treatment for him in Mogadishu, after which he was relocated to Dadaab for recovery. 
</p>
The officer in charge of Dadaab refugee camp, Omar Dadho, told Compass that authorities were doing their best to safeguard freedom of worship. “We cannot guarantee the security of the minority Christians among a Muslim-dominated population totaling more than 99 percent,” Dadho said. “But we are doing our best to safeguard their freedom of worship. Their leader, Salat, should visit our office so that their matter and complaints can be looked at critically, as well as to try to look for a long-lasting solution.”<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.crosswalk.com/news/religiontoday/11596821/">Somali Christian in Kenya Refugee Camp Shot</a><br>Simba Tian, Compass Direct, December 11, 2008</div></div>

<div class="quotes">A convert from Islam, Abdi Welli is an East Africa Pentecostal Church pastor from Kenya who in February tried to visit and encourage Christians, an invisibly tiny minority, in the religiously intolerant region of Somaliland.<br>. . .<br>
<p>When he arrived by car at the border crossing of Wajaale on Feb. 19 with all legal travel documents, his Bible and other Christian literature landed him in unexpected trouble with Somaliland immigration officials.
</p><p>&quot;I was beaten up for being in possession of Christian materials,&quot; Welli told Compass. &quot;They threatened to kill me if I did not renounce my faith, but I refused to their face. They were inhuman.&quot;
</p><p>Welli said the chief border official in Wajaale, whom he could identify only by his surname of Jama, took charge of most of the torturing. Welli said their threats were heart-numbing as they struggled to subdue him, with Jama and others saying they had killed two Somali Christians and would do the same to him.
</p><p>His pleas that he was a Kenyan whose faith was respected in his home country, he said, fell on deaf ears.
</p><p>&quot;I was abused, and they also abused my faith as the religion for pagans, which they said is unacceptable in their region,&quot; he said. &quot;I told them that I am Kenyan-born and brought up in Kenya, and my Christian faith is respected and recognized in Garissa.&quot;
</p>
Jama ordered Welli's incarceration, and he was locked up in an immigration cell for nine hours. The officials took from his bag three CDs containing his personal credentials and Christian educational literature. They also took his English Bible, two Christian books and US$400, he said.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://somalisforjesus.blogspot.com/2009/06/somalia-kenyan-pastor-beaten-at.html">Somalia: Kenyan Pastor Beaten At Somaliland Boarder</a><br>Compass Direct, May 8, 2009</div></div>

<p>The victims' frightened, weeping sisters and wives arrived at the police station in Baidoa on Friday to collect the mutilated bodies.
</p><p>A woman named Miriam, who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her from reprisals, sobbed as she said in a telephone call that four bodies, including her husband's, had been brought to the police station. The location of the other three was unclear.

She told The Associated Press that her brother had been missing for about 20 days after being abducted from his house by masked men, and that she had just been informed that he had been beheaded.

Al-Shabab militia officials told her that the seven had been accused of either renouncing the Islamic religion or spying for the government, she said.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,531405,00.html">Islamist Insurgents Behead 7 People in Somalia</a><br>Associated Press, July 10, 2009</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Muslim extremists early this morning killed a Christian convert in Mahadday Weyne, Somalia, 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Mogadishu. Al Shabaab Islamist rebels shot Mohammed Sheikh Abdiraman to death at 7 a.m., eyewitnesses told Compass. They said the Islamic extremists appeared to have been hunting the convert from Islam, and when they found him they did not hesitate to shoot him.
<p>The sources told Compass that Abdiraman was the leader of an underground “cell group” of Christians in Somalia.<br>. . .<br>
The militants reportedly beheaded seven Christians on July 10, and refugees from Somalia tell of other attacks. One refugee last year recounted an attack in Lower Juba, Somalia. Binti Ali Bilal, the 40-year-old mother of 10 children, was fetching firewood with her 23-year-old daughter, Asha Ibrahim Abdalla in April 2008 in an area called Yontoy when al Shabaab members and Muslim neighbors approached them. Yontoy is 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Kismayo.
</p><p>For some time the local community had suspected that she and her family were Christians, Bilal told Compass. The group asked the women if they were Christians, and when they said they were, the group began beating her and her daughter, who was six months pregnant, Bilal said. 
</p>

<div class="quotes">Fatima Sultan, Ali Ma'ow, Sheik Mohammed Abdi, and Maaddey Diil were killed by members of Al-Shabab, an Islamic extremist organization. The Islamists kidnapped and eventually beheaded the Christians after they refused to renounce their faith in Jesus Christ.
<p>On August 4, a junior Al-Shabab militant notified all the families of the victims that the four Christians had been beheaded for apostasy. He described the Christians as promoters of &quot;fitna,&quot; a Muslim term for religious discord. The militant, who called himself &quot;Seiful Islam&quot; (&quot;the Sword of Islam&quot;), told the families that the bodies will not be given to them &quot;as Somalia does not have cemeteries for infidels.&quot;
</p><p>One eye witness account said, &quot;All the four apostates were given an opportunity to return to Islam to be released but they all declined the generous offer.&quot;

The early morning shooting comes at a time when Islamist groups led by al Shabaab are hunting down converts to Christianity as they seek to establish sharia (Islamic law) throughout Somalia.

Ismael, who fled the area in 2005, said he received a telephone call from Matan two weeks ago in which the convert told him that monitoring by the Islamic extremists kept him from leaving his home and carrying out his small-trade business across the border in Mandera, in eastern Kenya. ‘I am afraid for my life — the al Shabaab want to get a proof that I follow the Christian faith,’ Matan told Ismael. ‘They have not been seeing me in the mosque and seem to have realized that I am not part of them.’”<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.compassdirect.org/english/country/somalia/4893/">Somali Christian Shot Dead near Kenya Border</a><br>Compass Direct, August 22, 2009</div></div>

Before Yusuf was executed by two shots to the head, reports filtered in to the Compass source that he had been badly beaten and his fingers broken as the Islamists tried to extract incriminating evidence against him and information about other Christians.

<div class="quotes">An underground Christian family from central Somalia is agonizing over the kidnapping of their daughter nearly eight months ago by Islamic militants bent on punishing those who leave Islam.
<p>Ghelle Hassan Aded told Compass that he has not seen his 15-year-old daughter, Anab Ghelle Hassan, since Islamic extremists from the al Shabaab (“the Youth”) insurgency kidnapped her on Feb. 15. Certain that the militants would come after the rest of the family, they immediately fled, said Aded, who spoke with Compass from an undisclosed location in Somalia’s autonomous region of Puntland.<br>. . .<br>
The al Shabaab insurgents fighting the Transitional Federal Government soon began monitoring the family’s activities. Aded said they took note that the family did not attend mosque, and on several occasions the insurgents or other Muslims questioned him. In Somalia, Christians hold small meetings in secret and are advised not to keep Bibles or other Christian literature at their homes; they often have to keep them buried in a hole.
</p><p>On Feb. 15, Aded and his wife sent young Hassan to the market to buy food, he said; relatives told them later that day that they saw al Shabaab insurgents kidnap her at 10 a.m. as she was going about her business at the local market. Knowing that the insurgents would soon come after the rest of his family, Aded said, he fled immediately with his wife, 11-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son to Puntland.
</p>
At their location in Puntland, the family appeared devastated by the kidnapping, with Aded’s wife often weeping over the loss, but they said they maintain hope of seeing Anab again.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.compassdirect.org/english/country/somalia/26696/">Somali Family Laments Kidnapping of Christian Girl</a><br>Compass Direct, October 6, 2010</div></div>

<div class="quotes">A 17-year-old girl in Somalia who converted to Christianity from Islam was shot to death last week in an apparent “honor killing,” area sources said.
<p>Nurta Mohamed Farah, who had fled her village of Bardher, Gedo Region to Galgadud Region to live with relatives after her parents tortured her for leaving Islam, died on Nov. 25. Area sources said they strongly suspected that the two unidentified men in Galgadud Region who shot her in the chest and head with a pistol were relatives or acting on their behest.<br>. . .<br>
Relatives buried Farah, sources said. Her parents had severely beaten her for leaving Islam and regularly shackled her to a tree at their home, Christian sources said. She had been confined to her home in Gedo region in southern Somalia since May 10, when her family found out that she had embraced Christianity, said a Christian leader who visited the area (see “Family of 17-Year-Old Somali Girl Abuses Her for Leaving Islam,” June 15).

<div class="quotes">January 7th in 2011 the holy warriors of Islam captured a Christian mother of four and slaughtered her in front of many villagers in Warbhigly in Somalia. Like usual the Koran holding individuals will have been shouting Allah Akbar while cutting the throat of Asha Mberwa.
<p>The 36 year old Asha Mberwa was a mother of four and she had committed no crime and had harmed nobody. However, Mohammed supported the killing of apostates therefore the Al-Shabaab killed the Muslim convert to Christianity in order to appease the Islamic god.
</p><p>In true Islamic justice an innocent convert to Christianity was killed in cold blood and bystanders were forced to watch while her throat was being cut. Her death, like so many other Christian martyrs in Somalia, is a witness to the reality of Islamic Sharia law and the brutal teachings of Mohammed. Therefore, the Islamic inquisition is in full swing in Somalia and Christians are being hunted down and killed.<br>. . .<br>
Asha Mberwa is the latest Christian martyr in Somalia to be killed by the followers of Islam who follow Islamic Sharia law, the teachings of the Koran and the Hadiths. This innocent Christian lady was killed by Muslims reciting the Koran and her death was slow and with the knowledge that the same Islamic fanatics would try to find her children and indoctrinate them.
</p>
It appears that the Christians of Somalia have been abandoned and if we look into the mirror then this Islamic inquisition is the same Islamic inquisition which befell the Buddhists and Hindus of Afghanistan in past history. Sadly, the annihilation of non-Muslim faiths is still being allowed but this darkness is not only a tragedy and a crime against humanity; it will also encourage Islamic jihadists to spread their hatred to new nations.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.aina.org/news/20110119204936.htm&date=2011-09-19?url=http://www.aina.org/news/20110119204936.htm&date=2011-09-19">Islamists Slit the Throat of a Christian Mother in Somalia</a><br>Lee Jay Walker, AINA, January 20, 2011</div></div>

<p>Sofia Osman, a 28-year-old Christian from Janale city in Somali’as Lower Shabelle region, had been taken into custody by Islamic extremist al Shabaab militants in November; the public whipping was meant to mark her release. She received 40 lashes on Dec. 22 while jeered by spectators.

</p><p>The whipping was administered in front of hundreds of spectators after Osman was released from her month-long custody in al Shabaab camps. Nursing her injuries at her family’s home, in the days after the punishment she would not talk to anyone and looked dazed, a source close in touch with the family said. She has since been relocated.
</p><p>“Please pray for her quick recovery,” the source said.
</p><p>Janale, one Somalia’s major cities, is about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Mogadishu.
</p><p>Osman became a Christian four years ago and was a member of the underground church in the war-torn Horn of Africa country largely controlled by the al Qaeda-linked militants from al Shabaab.

<div class="quotes">Al Shabab, an Al Qaeda-linked terror group in Somalia, has sought to rid the region of Christians and is specifically targeting Christian converts from Islam. Many Somali Christians, having fled persecution in their homeland, have found little security in neighbouring East African countries. Even in the Christian-majority country of Kenya, radical Islam is steadily gaining numbers and influence.
<p>Two months ago, three Christian converts from Islam returned to their homeland to attend a university in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu. The men, whose identities have been concealed for their protection, had been working in Ethiopia and converted to Christianity in 2005. Upon their return, however, people grew suspicious when the men were not seen praying at the local mosque.
</p><p>‘One of our fellow students jokingly questioned us about why we were not serious about attending prayers at the mosque,’ recalled one of the men. ‘I kept quiet and the discussion ended. Three days later is when we were attacked.’
</p><p>On June 25, six armed Al Shabab militants entered the Christians’ home and opened fire. The Christians were found by neighbors and were rushed to the hospital. All three suffered gunshot wounds and, after spending a week in the hospital, they determined it was no longer safe to live in Somalia. The men crossed the southern border into eastern Kenya joining thousands of other displaced Somalis in refugee camps in Dadaab.
</p><p>Local sources told ICC that Al Shabab had been closely monitoring the men for months. ‘New arrivals outside of Somalia are monitored by Al Shabab because they are considered to support western ideologies, including foreign religions, and they are viewed as sympathizers to the West,’ said a Somali journalist in the area. ‘That is why they were victimized.’
</p>
The men’s plight is one among many acts of violent extremism that has targeted the Somali Christian community in recent months. In a similar case, a Christian family fled Buula-barde, a village in central Somalia, after receiving death threats in May. ‘The extremists began sending threatening messages to their mobile phones to recant their faith or face execution,’ …<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.persecution.org/2012/09/07/somali-christians-fear-militant-islam-at-home-and-abroad/&date=2012-09-09?url=http://www.persecution.org/2012/09/07/somali-christians-fear-militant-islam-at-home-and-abroad/&date=2012-09-09">Somali Christians Fear Militant Islam At Home And Abroad</a><br>International Christian Concern, September 7, 2012</div></div>

Surviving widow and five children flee their home in fear</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">Gunmen in central Somalia on Saturday (Dec. 8) killed an underground Christian who had been receiving death threats for leaving Islam, area sources said.
<p>Two unidentified masked men shot Mursal Isse Siad, 55, outside his home in Beledweyne, 206 miles (332 kilometers) north of Mogadishu, for leaving Islam, Muslim and Christian sources told Morning Star News. The assailants fled immediately after the murder. 
</p><p>Siad’s oldest daughter (name withheld), 15, said her father was killed “because he failed to attend the mosque for prayers and used to pray at home. He used to share with us about Jesus.” She said that he had received messages on his mobile phone stating, “We know what you are doing, and you must stop, otherwise you risk your life.”
</p><p>Siad’s 42-year-old wife (name withheld), three daughters and two sons have fled the area, fearing for their lives.
</p><p>A Christian source in Mogadishu confirmed the killing, and a Muslim resident of the Beledweyne area also said Siad was killed for leaving Islam.
</p><p>“Siad deserved to die because he was not committed to the Islamic religion,” the resident said.
</p><p>Siad and his wife, who converted to Christianity in 2000 according to a source who used to worship with them, had moved to Beledweyne from Doolow eight months ago, after Somalia’s transitional federal government and African Union Mission in Somalia troops captured Beledweyne from Al Shabaab rebels. Siad had taken a job with a local Non-Governmental Organization.
</p>
“Since we arrived from Doolow, my parents have not been attending the worship at the mosque, but they have been allowing us to worship at the nearby mosque,” his daughter said.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://morningstarnews.org/2012/12/christian-shot-to-death-in-somalia/&date=2012-12-29?url=http://morningstarnews.org/2012/12/christian-shot-to-death-in-somalia/&date=2012-12-29">Christian Shot to Death in Somalia</a><br>Morning Star News, December 14, 2012</div></div>
