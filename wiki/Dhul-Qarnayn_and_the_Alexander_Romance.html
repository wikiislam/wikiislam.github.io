<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>The story of Dhul-Qarnayn (in <a href="wiki/Arabic.html" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> ذو القرنين, literally &quot;The Two-Horned One&quot;, also transliterated as Zul-Qarnain or Zulqarnain) is found in the 18<sup>th</sup> <a href="wiki/Surah.html" title="Surah">Surah</a> of the Qur'an, <a href="wiki/The_Holy_Qur'an-_Al-Kahf_(The_Cave).html" title="The Holy Qur'an: Al-Kahf (The Cave)">al-Kahf</a> (the Cave).  While he is never mentioned explicitly by name, the story is clearly based upon a <a href="wiki/Legends.html" title="Legends">legendary</a> account of Alexander the Great.  For centuries, most Muslim historians and Qur'anic commentators endorsed the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn as Alexander, though some also proposed alternatives. In recent years, this identification of Dhul-Qarnayn has become particularly problematic and controversial for Muslim scholars, as historians have gradually discovered that the historical Alexander was a Greek <a href="wiki/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> who fashioned himself as a <a href="wiki/God.html" title="God">god</a>. This has prompted many <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> to create and advance alternative theories that identify  Dhul-Qarnayn as other prominent historical kings, most notably Cyrus the Great. These alternative theories have major deficiencies and fall short of the strong parallels between the Qur'anic story and legends of Alexander that date to the early 7<sup>th</sup> century.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_vs_Legendary_Alexander">Historical vs Legendary Alexander</span></h3>
<p>What is overlooked by most apologists when discussing the identify of Dhul-Qarnayn<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> is that the story in the Qur'an is not based on an historically accurate account of Alexander III of Macedon (356–323 BC).  Instead, it is based entirely upon legendary stories of Alexander which bare little resemblance to the Alexander of history.  In particular, the Qur'an parallels a Syriac legend where Alexander is portrayed as a monotheistic king who awaits the second coming of the Messiah and the end of the world.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>It has been well understood for many centuries that legendary accounts of Alexander's life began shortly after his death in 323 BC.  These were popular across most of <a href="wiki/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, North <a href="wiki/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the <a href="wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="wiki/Iran.html" title="Iran">Persia</a> and even <a href="wiki/India.html" title="India">India</a> and <a href="wiki/China.html" title="China">China</a>.  In the subsequent centuries after his death, the historical accounts of Alexander were largely forgotten and legendary accounts of his deeds and adventures replaced them in popular folklore.  It is these legendary depictions of Alexander that would have been known in the 7<sup>th</sup> century and not the historically accurate accounts of his life.  It was not until the Renaissance in the 16<sup>th</sup> century that the first historical accounts of Alexanders life were rediscovered and investigated.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oral_Tradition">Oral Tradition</span></h3>
<p>Some may object to the literary link between the Qur'anic story and the legendary Alexander story on the basis that they believe Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> was not a literate man and could not have read the Alexander legend.  Muhammad's ability to read, however, is irrelevant to the inclusion of the story in the Qur'an as most stories in ancient communities were shared orally. Since the vast majority of people in 7<sup>th</sup> century Arabia and the Middle East were illiterate, most stories were passed on through word of mouth. It is through this telling and re-telling of stories that this legend likely came to be known by the author of the Qur'an.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Parallels_to_the_Syriac_Legend">Parallels to the Syriac Legend</span></h2>
<p>In 1889, the renowned scholar and philologist, Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis Budge, translated five Alexander stories from Syriac manuscripts into English. One of these stories was a legend that detailed the exploits of Alexander, the son of Philip the Macedonian, and how he traveled to the ends of the world, made a gate of iron, and shut behind it the Huns so they might not come forth to spoil the land.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup>  The parallels between this story and the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Qur'an are detailed below.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Two_Horns">Two Horns</span></h3>
<p>Alexander in the Syriac legend is described as having horns on his head. An Ethiopic variation of the story refers to Alexander as &quot;the two horns&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup> Coins depicting Alexander with ram horns on his head were first minted shortly after his death. By the 1<sup>st</sup> century BC, silver coins depicting Alexander with ram horns were used as the primary currency in Arabia. Imitation coins were issued by an Arab ruler named Abi'el who ruled in the south-eastern region of the Arabian Peninsula and other minting of these coins occurred throughout Arabia for another thousand years.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> This connection of Alexander with two-horns was widely known across the region at the time.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And king Alexander bowed himself and did reverence, saying, &quot;0 God, Lord of kings and judges, thou who settest up kings and destroyest their power, I know in my mind that thou hast exalted me above all kings, and thou hast <b>made me horns upon my head</b>, wherewith I might thrust down the kingdoms of the world;<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 146</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Established_with_Power">Established with Power</span></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Syriac legend, Alexander says a prayer to God that he might be given power from heaven to rule over the kingdoms of the earth.  The Qur'anic story, speaking from the perspective of Allah, says that he has given Alexander power on earth.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
<b>Give me power from thy holy heavens that I may receive strength greater than [that of] the kingdoms of the world</b> and that I may humble them, and I will magnify thy name, O Lord, for ever, and thy memorial shall be from everlasting to everlasting, and I will write the name of God in the charter of my kingdom, that there may be for Thee a memorial always.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 146</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Journey_to_the_Fetid_Sea">Journey to the Fetid Sea</span></h3>
<p>The first destination for the hero in both the Syriac and Qur'anic stories is a place near the setting of the sun.  The Syriac legend identifies this location as Oceanus, a mythical sea believed to encircle a <a href="wiki/Flat_Earth_and_the_Quran.html" title="Flat Earth and the Quran">flat earth</a>.  In both accounts, the water is described as being muddy or fetid.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
<p>&quot;As to the thing, my lord, which thy majesty (or thy greatness) desires to go and see, namely, upon what the heavens rest, and what surrounds the earth, the terrible seas which surround the world will not give thee a passage'; because there are eleven bright seas, on which the ships of men sail, and beyond these there is about ten miles of dry land, and beyond these ten miles <b>there is the fetid sea</b>, Oceanus (the Ocean), which surrounds all creation. 
</p>
And they put ships to sea and sailed on the sea four months' and twelve days, and they arrived at the dry land beyond the eleven bright seas.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 145-147</div></div>
<div class="quotes">One (such) way he followed, until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring of <b>murky water</b>: Near it he found a People: We said: &quot;O Zul-qarnain!

<p>Dr. Kevin Van Bladel, professor of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, states in his comparison of the two stories, that the water at the place where the sun sets is 'fetid' in both texts, a coincidence of two uncommon synonyms (Syriac saryâ, Arabic hami'a).<sup id="cite_ref-VanBladel_4-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-VanBladel-4">[4]</a></sup> Similar connections can be found in Islamic poetry contemporary to the time of Muhammad. Muhammad ibn Ishāq ibn Yasār ibn Khiyār recorded many pre-Islamic Arabic poems in his <a href="wiki/Sirat_Rasul_Allah.html" title="Sirat Rasul Allah">Sirat Rasul Allah</a> (Biography of Muhammad);  This included a poem about Dhul-Qarnayn that he claims was composed by a pre-Islamic king of ancient <a href="wiki/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>.  Here we can see that the sun sets into a pool of water that is described as being both muddy and fetid, a perfect linking of the two adjectives in both the Qur'anic and Syriac stories.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
Conquered kings thronged his court, East and west he ruled, yet he sought Knowledge true from a learned sage. He saw where the sun sinks from view, In a <b>pool of mud and fetid slime</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Punishment_of_Wrongdoers">Punishment of Wrongdoers</span></h3>
<p>The Qur'anic story next gives the reader a cryptic speech by Dhul-Qarnayn where he says that &quot;whoever does wrong&quot; will be sent back to the Lord (i.e. killed). The Syriac legend gives a much fuller account; it explains that Alexander asked for criminals to be sent to the shore of the fetid sea to test a rumor that anyone who approaches the sea dies. When the prisoners drop dead, Alexander notes that it is good that those already &quot;guilty of death should die&quot;. Not only is there a direct parallel between the stories, but the Syriac legend helps makes sense of the short and cryptic Qur'anic version of the story.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And Alexander and his troops encamped, and he sent and called to him the governor who was in the camp, and said to him, &quot;Are there any men here guilty of death?&quot; They said to him, &quot;We have thirty and seven <b>men in bonds who are guilty of death</b>.&quot; And the king said to the governor, &quot;Bring hither <b>those evil doers</b>.&quot; And they brought them, and the king commanded them and said, &quot;Go ye to the shore of the fetid sea, and hammer in stakes that ships may be tied thereto, and prepare everything needful for a force about to cross the sea.&quot; And the men went, and came to the shore of the sea. Now Alexander thought within himself, &quot;If it be true as they say, that everyone who comes near the fetid sea dies, <b>it is better that these who are guilty of death should die</b>,&quot; and when they had gone, and had arrived at the shore of the sea, <b>they died instantly</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 147-148</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sun_Rises_on_People_with_No_Cover">Sun Rises on People with No Cover</span></h3>
<p>After leaving the muddy sea, The Qur'an tells us that Dhul-Qarnayn travels to the east where the sun rises. The author then conveys an odd and cryptic detail that the people living there have &quot;no covering protection against the sun&quot;; however, it gives no further explanation as to what that means. Again, the Syriac legend not only has an expanded, parallel account but it helps clarify the Qur'anic story. We are told that the people who live near the location where the sun &quot;enters the window of heaven&quot; (i.e. rises above the flat earth) must seek cover because the sun is much closer to the ground and its rays burn the people and animals there.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
So the whole camp mounted, and Alexander and his troops went up between the fetid sea and the bright sea <b>to the place where the sun enters the window of heaven</b>; for the sun is the servant of the Lord, and neither by night nor by day does he cease from his travelling. The place of his rising is over the sea, and the people who dwell there, when he is about to rise, flee away and hide themselves in the sea, that they be not burnt by his rays; and he passes through the midst of the heavens to the place where he enters the window of heaven; and wherever he passes there are terrible mountains, and those who dwell there have caves hollowed out in the rocks, and <b>as soon as they see the sun passing [over them], men and birds flee away from before him and hide in the caves</b>, for rocks are rent by his blazing heat and fall down, and whether they be men or beasts, as soon as the stones touch them they are consumed.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 148</div></div>

<p>On his final journey, the Qur'an tells us that Dhul-Qarnayn traveled to a valley between two mountains. The Syriac legend tells us that Alexander heads north and likewise arrives at a plain between mountains. Here he sets up his camp near a mountain pass.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And Alexander said, &quot; Let us go forth by the way to the north &quot;; and they came to the confines of the north, and entered Armenia and Adarbaijan and Inner Armenia And they crossed over the country of TurnAgios, and BethPardia, and Beth-Tekil, and Beth-Drubil, and Beth-Katarmen, and Beth-Gebul, and Beth-Zamrat Alexander passed through nil these places; and <b>he went and passed mount Musas and entered a plain</b> which is Bahi-Lebta, and <b>he went and encamped by the gate of the great mountain.</b><sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 149</div></div>

<p>The Syriac legend then states that Alexander meets with people who live near the mountain pass.  These natives tell of a tribe, the Huns, who live beyond the pass. These Huns spoil and ravage the land and then return back to their lands on the other side of the mountain. The legend identifies the first two kings of this tribe as Gog and Magog, the exact same names used in the Qur'anic account.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Build_a_Barrier">Build a Barrier</span></h3>
<p>After speaking with the people about Gog and Magog, Alexander says he will build a barrier (a wall or dam) between the people and the tribes that harass them. Both stories record Alexander proclaiming this in a speech. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">
When Alexander had heard what the old men said, he marveled greatly at the great sea which surrounded all creation; and Alexander said to his troops, &quot; Do ye desire that we should do something wonderful in this land?&quot; They said to him, &quot;As thy majesty commands we will do.&quot; The king said, &quot;<b>Let us make a gate of brass and close up this breach</b>.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 153</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Made_of_Iron_and_Brass">Made of Iron and Brass</span></h3>
<p>Another similarity between the two stories is that the wall will be made of both iron and brass.  Here the Qur'anic translators use different words for the second metal: &quot;lead&quot; (Yusif Ali), &quot;copper&quot; (Pickthall), &quot;brass&quot; (Shakir) but the connection with the Syriac legend is apparent.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And Alexander commanded and fetched three thousand smiths, workers in iron, and three thousand men, workers in brass And <b>they put down brass and iron</b>, and kneaded it as a man kneads when he works clay.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cannot_be_Breached">Cannot be Breached</span></h3>
<p>After constructing the barrier, the Syriac legend says that it is very difficult to penetrate and the Huns will not be able to dig under it.  A similar phrase is used in the Qur'an to convey that the barrier is very difficult to pass.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
He fixed the gate and the bolts, and he placed nails of iron and beat them down one by the other, so that <b>if the Huns came and dug out the rock which was under the threshold</b> of iron, even if footmen were able to pass through, <b>a horse with its rider would be unable to pass</b>, so long as the gate that was hammered down with bolts stood.<sup id="cite_ref-Budge_2-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Budge-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The History of Alexander the Great, Being the Syriac Version, p. 153</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Destroyed_at_the_End_of_Times">Destroyed at the End of Times</span></h3>
<p>An often overlooked aspect of the story of Dhul-Qarnayn is that it ends with a prophetic prediction of the wall being destroyed and the tribes of Gog and Magog surging and destroying everything in their path. In particular, it notes that this will occur on the day of Judgement when the &quot;trumpet is blown&quot; and the people of the world are gathered together to account for their sins. The Syriac legend also ends with a similar prophecy that likewise occurs when the nations have been gathered together at the end of times.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
And <b>the Lord will gather together the kings and their hosts</b> which are within this mountain, and they shall all be assembled at His beck, and shall come with their spears and swords, and shall stand behind the gate, and shall look up to the heavens, and shall call upon the name of the Lord,&quot;saying, 'O Lord, open to us this gate.'

<p>The connection with the destruction of the wall and the end of times is further explained in the classic Qur'anic <a href="wiki/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">tafsir</a> by Ibn Kathir.
</p>

As-Sur, as explained in the Hadith, is a horn that is blown into. The one who will blow into it is (the angel) Israfil, peace be upon him, as has been explained in the Hadith quoted at length above, and there are many Hadiths on this topic.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Tafsir Ibn Kathir, &quot;The Barrier restrains Them, but It will be breached when the Hour draws nigh&quot;</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h3>
<p>After seeing the numerous and explicit connections between the Qur'an and the Syriac Legend, it is easy to agree with Van Bladel who summaries the parallels between the two stories.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
<p>Thus, quite strikingly, almost every element of this short Qur'anic tale finds a more explicit and detailed counterpart in the Syriac Alexander Legend.  In both text the related events are given in precisely the same order.
</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dating_the_Alexander_Legend">Dating the Alexander Legend</span></h2>
<p>The parallels between the Syriac Legend and the Qur'an are obvious and striking and both accounts are clearly telling the same story. After establishing this fact, we must now determine the dependency between the two stories. Is the Qur'anic story based on the Syriac story? Is the Syriac story based on the Qur'an? Are both dependent upon earlier stories? In order to determine the answer to those questions, we must look at scholarly works that date both the Qur'anic account, the Syriac legend, and prior Alexander folklore.
</p><p>While the Syriac story tells a specific version of the Alexander Romance, many aspects of this legend draw from earlier materials. Similar stories of Alexander pre-date both the Qur'an and Syriac legends by many centuries including folklore found in earlier Christian and Jewish writings. Parallels to the ancient Epic of Gilgamesh and the Biblical story of Gog and Magog can be clearly identified in the story as well.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Epic_of_Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</span></h3>
<p>One of the earliest and most influential stories, the Epic of Gilgamesh was written sometime before 2000 BCE. In one of the tablets of his many adventures, Gilgamesh travels far to the east, to the mountain passes at the ends of the earth. He slays mountain lions, bears and other wild animals. Eventually he comes to the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth, from where the sun rises. Here he finds a large gate, guarded by scorpion-people who protect the sun and forbidden anyone to enter through the gate without their permission.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>It is in this very ancient mythology, that we have the basic outline of the adventure found in the Qur'an and the Alexander legends: a powerful hero, who travels from west to east, the setting and rising of the sun, two mountains and a gate.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_Jewish_Legends">Early Jewish Legends</span></h3>
<p>The Jewish historian Josephus (37-100 CE), records in his two books legendary stories of Alexander that were known to the Jews of the first century. In his first book, &quot;The Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, he mentions that the tribes of Magog are called the Scythians by the Greeks. In his second book, &quot;The Wars of the Jews&quot;, he further details that these people are held behind a wall of iron that has been built by Alexander the Great. In this legend, Josephus relates that Alexander allows the tribes of Magog to come out from behind the wall and create havoc in the land. Here we see a very clear connection of Alexander to an iron gate and the tribes of Magog being prevented from plundering the land. This shows that local folklore already contained the basic backbone of the Alexander story almost six centuries before the story found in the Qur'an.
</p>

He refers to these invaders as Huns who live near the gate that was built by Alexander.
</p>
<div class="quotes"> For news came that the hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from Mæotis (they had their haunts between the icy Tanais and the rude Massagetæ; where <b>the gates of Alexander keep back the wild peoples</b> behind the Caucasus); and that, speeding here and there on their nimble-footed horses, they were filling all the world with panic and bloodshed.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref"> Letters of St. Jerome, Letter 77</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dating_the_Syriac_Legend">Dating the Syriac Legend</span></h3>
<p>The Alexander Legend was composed by a Mesopotamian Christian probably in Amid or Edessa. It was written down in 629-630 CE after the victory of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius over the Sasanian king Khusrau Parvez. Dr. Reinink, a Near East philogist and scholar, highlights the political agenda of the legend which is clearly written as a piece of pro-Byzantine propaganda. Its purpose was probably to win the separated Syrian Christians back to a union with the church at Constantinople.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>According to Muslim scholars, Al-Kahf (The Cave) was generally revealed in Mecca, except verse 28 and verses 83-101 which were revealed in Medina.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Based on this information, we can date the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, contained in verses 83-101, sometime after the Hijra in June 622 CE and before Muhammed's death in June 632 CE; a more specific date is difficult to ascertain with any certainty. Since the community of Muslims in Mecca were far from well known outside of Arabia, the possibility of their story influencing Christians in Syria is extremely remote. The Syriac work also contains no references to the Arabic phrases used in the Qur'anic account, which would be expected if the Syrian story was using that as its source.<sup id="cite_ref-VanBladel_4-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-VanBladel-4">[4]</a></sup> While the timelines are tight, it is clear that the composition of the Syriac legend fits into the timeline of the Qur'anic revelation and likely pre-dates it.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spread_of_the_Syriac_Legend_to_Arabia">Spread of the Syriac Legend to Arabia</span></h3>
<p>The popularity of the Syriac legend of Alexander is evidenced by its inclusion in other works soon after its composition. The &quot;Song of Alexander&quot;, composed a few years later but before the Arab conquest of Syria sometime between 630 CE and 636 CE.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary_2">Summary</span></h3>
<p>It should be clear that all the major elements of the Alexander story were in place by the 4<sup>th</sup> century, predating both the Qur'anic and the Syriac account by hundreds of years. The strong, point-by-point connection between the story of Dhul-Qarnayn and prior legends is undeniable. In effect, the story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Qur'an is simply another example of the widespread inclusion of Alexander folklore into the stories and traditions of the religious groups in the Middle East.  Rebecca Edwards in a address to the American Philological Association in 2002 states:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Alexander's association with two horns and with the building of the gate against Gog and Magog occurs much earlier than the Quran and persists in the beliefs of all three of these religions Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The denial of Alexander's identity as Dhul-Qarnayn is the denial of a common heritage shared by the cultures which shape the modern world--both in the east and the west.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p>While the Qur'an and Hadith never explicitly identify Dhul-Qarnayn as Alexander, a number of Islamic scholars and commentators have endorsed this view. This was especially true in the early centuries after the founding of Islam when the legends of Alexander were still widely known and popular. In more recent years, some prominent scholars have also supported the connection between Alexander and Dhul-Qarnayn of the Qur'an.

<p>The Sirat Rasul Allah of Ibn Ishaq, circa 761 CE, mentions that Dhul-Qarnayn was of Egyptian and Greek origins, a pretty good description of Alexander who came from Macedonia in Greece and conquered Egypt.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Reconstructing_the_Historical_Alexander">Reconstructing the Historical Alexander</span></h2>
<p>While legendary accounts of Alexander's life dominated Europe and the Middle East for almost two thousands years, eventually more historical biographies about his life were unearthed. This included information about Alexander as a polytheist, Zeus worshiping pagan and insight into his personal and sexual preferences. Such historical facts about Alexander the Great became well known only after the Renaissance period (1300-1600 CE) when Greek documents from the 2<sup>nd</sup> century were rediscovered.  
</p><p>These included the &quot;Anabasis Alexandri&quot; or &quot;the Campaigns of Alexander&quot; by Arrian.  It is generally considered the most important source on Alexander the Great. Written in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century, it gives a detailed history of Alexander's military complains and is based on early sources that are now lost. The other is the &quot;Life of Alexander&quot; and two orations &quot;On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great&quot; , by the Greek historian and biographer Plutarch of Chaeronea.  This work detailed much of Alexander's personal life, desires, motivations, and other personal insights.<sup id="cite_ref-Plutarch_21-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Plutarch-21">[21]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Polytheism">Polytheism</span></h3>
<p>Alexander the Great was a polytheist who believed in the pantheon of Greek gods, the dominant religious belief at the time of the 4<sup>th</sup> century BCE in Macedon Greece and throughout most of the Mediterranean. When his army first invaded Asia, Alexander dedicated the lands of his conquests to the gods. He visited the Oracle at Delphi and sought prophecies about his future.  After his death, Alexander apparently left instructions in his will for a monumental temple to Athena be built at Troy.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Cyrus_the_Great">Cyrus the Great</span></h2>
<p>Recent historical and archaeological evidence clearly points to the real Alexander of Macedon as a polytheistic pagan who fashioned himself after Greek and Egyptian gods. The more recent questions about Alexander's sexuality and personal relationships also raises serious problems for anyone who believes he was a follower of Islam.  Based on this information, some apologists have constructed alternative theories to the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn.  The most prominent alternative theory among modern apologists is that Dhul-Qarnayn was Cyrus the Great of Persia. This theory has been advanced by  Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi,<sup id="cite_ref-Maududi_26-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Maududi-26">[26]</a></sup> Maulana Abul Kalam Azad,<sup id="cite_ref-Azad_27-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Azad-27">[27]</a></sup> Allameh Tabatabaei,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> and Naser Makarem Shirazi.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>It is important to note that these rejections of Alexander as Dhul-Qarnayn are primarily motivated by theological concerns and are not based on any convincing evidence. As we shall see, the claims of Cyrus the Great being Dhul-Qarnayn are far weaker than the obvious connection to the legendary stories of Alexander. Proponents of this theory, however, pre-suppose that the Qur'an is relaying an accurate, historical story and thus never take into consideration the possibility that the story is based on myth and folklore.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Turning-point_of_Alexander_as_Dhul-Qarnayn">Turning-point of Alexander as Dhul-Qarnayn</span></h3>
<p>In the first few centuries after the founding of Islam, there was little controversy in identifying Dhul-Qarnayn as Alexander. Alexander's deeds and exploits were almost universally admired.  However this slowly changed after the Renaissance in the 16<sup>th</sup> century when proper archaeological and historical methods were first applied to the life of Alexander the Great.
</p><p>Once an accurate picture of the historical Alexander emerged, Christians and Jews easily discarded the legends of Alexander as a believing king.  Since these accounts were not present in the Bible, rejecting Alexander as a Greek pagan held no theological consequences for them.  Muslims, on the other hand, are forced to defend these accounts because the stories found their way into the Qur'an.  While some Muslims have embraced Alexander and rejected modern scholarship around his historical identify,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> most apologists have gone the other way and decided to accept that Alexander was a pagan but reject his association with Dhul-Qarnayn.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rejection_of_Alexander">Rejection of Alexander</span></h3>
<p>Since most early Muslim scholars and commentators believed that Dhul-Qarnayn was Alexander, any defense of the Cyrus theory is first obligated to state why Alexander should be rejected from consideration.<sup id="cite_ref-Azad_27-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Azad-27">[27]</a></sup> Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, one of the first to advance the theory of Cyrus, gives a typical justification for his rejection of Alexander by appealing to the historical man as an unrighteous polytheist:
</p>
<div class="quotes">When treating the Dhul-Qarnayn story, Azad beings by setting forth that it follows from verse 82/83 that the hero's epithet was familiar to the Jews, being an expression used by the questioners.  Then, he must have been a righteous (see verse 86/87) and godly (see verses 87/88, 94/95 and 97/98) sovereign.  In other words, he cannot represent Alexander the Great: &quot;That man was neither godly, nor righteous, nor generous towards subjected nations; moreover, he did not build a wall&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-Azad_27-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Azad-27">[27]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Modern Muslim Koran Interpretation: (1880 - 1960), p. 32</div></div>
<p>The apologist insists that the only possible connection to Alexander must be to the historical man. On this basis, it is easy to agree that the historical Alexander is not portrayed in the Qur'anic story, as he does not fit the description at all. However, the legendary Alexander is a perfect fit. He is portrayed as a godly and righteous man, he shows generosity to the people harassed by the Huns, and he builds a wall of iron and brass. While these legendary stories were popular in the 7<sup>th</sup> century, they are virtually unknown outside of academic circles today. The apologist simply ignores these facts and never presents the option that these verses are about a legendary figure.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Two_Horns_2">Two Horns</span></h3>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><a href="wiki/File-Cyrushorns.jpg.html" class="image"><img alt="" src="wiki/uploads/thumb/a/a9/Cyrushorns.jpg/200px-Cyrushorns.jpg" width="200" height="260" class="thumbimage" srcset="/wiki/uploads/a/a9/Cyrushorns.jpg 1.5x, /wiki/uploads/a/a9/Cyrushorns.jpg 2x"></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="wiki/File-Cyrushorns.jpg.html" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Sketch of a relief of Cyrus.</div></div></div>
<p>In order to connect Cyrus to the epithet Dhul-Qarnayn (i.e. man with two-horns), proponents of this theory have pointed to reliefs found at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae, Iran.  In these depictions of Cyrus, a set of horns can be seen at the bottom of an elaborate head dress.  However, the horns are extremely small and difficult to identify. When you compare this to the prominent placement of horns in Alexander coins and the depiction of Zeus-Ammon, upon which the Alexander coins are based, the horns on the Cyrus relief pale by comparison. We have no other physical engravings or any other archaeological evidence that connects Cyrus with the epithet &quot;two horns&quot;.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Questions_from_the_People_of_the_Book">Questions from the People of the Book</span></h3>
<p>Another attempt to connect Cyrus to Dhul-Qarnayn comes from an analysis of the events that prompted the revelation of the Qur'anic story in the first place. The story begins in verse 83 by stating that someone has asked Muhammad about the story of Dhul-Qarnayn:
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>They ask thee</b> concerning Zul-qarnain. Say, &quot;I will rehearse to you something of his story.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/018-qmt.php#018.083#018.083">18:83</a></div></div>
<p>The &quot;they&quot; in question is often identified as Jews, or sometimes generally as the <a href="wiki/Islam_and_the_People_of_the_Book.html" title="Islam and the People of the Book">People of the Book</a>, living near Mecca who use the question as a test of Muhammad's prophet-hood
</p>
<div class="quotes">This Surah was sent down in answer to the three questions which the mushriks of Makkah, in consultation with the people of the Book, had put to the Holy Prophet in order to test him. These were: (1) Who were &quot;the Sleepers of the Cave&quot;? (2) What is the real story of Khidr? and (3) What do you know about Dhul-Qarnayn? As these three questions and the stories involved concerned the history of the Christians and the Jews, and were unknown in Hijaz, a choice of these was made to test whether the Holy Prophet possessed any source of the knowledge of the hidden and unseen things.<sup id="cite_ref-Maududi18_31-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Maududi18-31">[31]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">The Meaning of the Qur'an, Introduction to Chapter 18</div></div>
<p>Apologists then argue that the identity of Dhul-Qarnayn must have been well known to the Jews and should therefore be found in the Bible. However, no justification is ever given as to why only the Bible is considered and not other literature used by Jews and Christians of the 7<sup>th</sup> century.  This includes the Talmud, apocryphal books, and other non-canonical writings. In fact, this very account refers to another non-canonical story, <a href="wiki/Seven_Sleepers_of_Ephesus_in_the_Quran.html" title="Seven Sleepers of Ephesus in the Quran">the Sleepers of the Cave</a>, which is a 5<sup>th</sup> century legend popular in both Syria and Arabia. This story is not found in the Bible and therefore provides definitive proof that the people questioning Muhammad relied on extra-Biblical material for their questions. 
</p><p>Another detail about this account that is completely ignored by Islamic scholars, is that Muhammad is not asked to simply identify Dhul-Qarnayn. If that were the case, he could have given a one sentence answer such as &quot;he is Alexander&quot; or &quot;he is Cyrus&quot;. He is actually asked to relate a <i>story</i> about Dhul-Qarnayn. In this context, it is assumed that everyone at the time is familiar with this person, but they are asking Muhammad for details of Dhul-Qarnayn's deeds.  In order for the People of the Book to know the &quot;right&quot; answer to that question, they must already know the details of this story. This story does not appear anywhere in the Bible; but it does occur, point-by-point and detail-by-detail in the Alexander legend. Therefore, they must be using the Alexander legend as their source for the &quot;right&quot; answer.
</p><p>Again, apologists are simply ignoring the wide range of stories used by Jews and Christians of the 7<sup>th</sup> century. They project a modern understanding of the cannon of scripture back upon the people of that time. When we consider that the Alexander legends were incorporated into the writings and theology of the Jews and Christians in Syria and Arabia, it is easy to see why it should be included as the most likely source of these questions.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reference_in_the_Bible">Reference in the Bible</span></h3>
<p>While trying to link the phrase &quot;two horns&quot; to Cyrus in the Bible, the apologists will cite a passage from Daniel 8 that mentions a ram with two horns:
</p>
<div class="quotes">In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. I looked up, and there before me was <b>a ram with two horns</b>, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. <b>One of the horns was longer than the other</b> but grew up later. I watched the ram as it charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it pleased and became great. As I was thinking about this, suddenly <b>a goat with a prominent horn between its eyes came from the west</b>, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. It came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at it in great rage. I saw it attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat knocked it to the ground and trampled on it, and none could rescue the ram from its power.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Daniel 8:2-7</div></div>
<p>The meaning of this prophetic vision is explained a few verses later; the identities of the two-horned ram and the one-horned goat are given:
</p>
<div class="quotes">He said: “I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end.  <b>The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia</b>. The shaggy <b>goat is the king of Greece</b>, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Daniel 8:19-21</div></div>
<p>On the one hand, the two-horned ram is associated with Persia, and it conquering foes to the west, north, and south is a reference to Cyrus leading Persia to become a great power in the region. However, linking Cyrus explicitly to both of the &quot;two horns&quot; is problematic. First, the author of Daniel clearly says that the ram represents two kings and not only one king. The implication is that Persia is the longer and newer of the two horns, since Persia was more powerful and rose in ascension later than Media. The horn was a common metaphor for rulers or kings in the Middle East, so this imagery is not unique to Persian kings or Cyrus the Great.  The clear explanation given in the text is that the ram represents the Persia-Media empire in general and not Cyrus in particular. Since the ram was considered a symbol of Persia, this is not a unique depiction.<sup id="cite_ref-Guzik_33-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Guzik-33">[33]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another problem with identifying Cyrus as the ram is that the ram is defeated and disgraced by the goat. It is well known that Cyrus was responsible for freeing the Jews from slavery in Babylon<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> and he is always portrayed favorably in the Bible. In the Book of Isaiah, Cyrus is even called God's anointed <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> which is the same word used for Messiah or Savior. However, in this prophetic vision, the goat defeats the ram and tramples it, which is completely at odds with how Cyrus is portrayed throughout the rest of Jewish scripture. Again, this clearly shows that the Ram represents Persia as a whole and not Cyrus as an individual.  
</p><p>We must also consider that Cyrus is mentioned explicitly by name 23 times<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> in the Bible including other parts of the Book of Daniel; yet he is never given the epitaph of &quot;Two Horns&quot;. If the Jews knew Cyrus by this epitaph then we should expect to see it mentioned in at least one of these verses. When we consider that Alexander is said to have two horns in the Alexander legend, this lack of direct reference to Cyrus further weakens this theory.
</p><p>The horn on the goat is considered by many to be a reference to Alexander the Great. The horn is called &quot;the king of Greece&quot; that comes form the west and charges to the east destroying everything in its path; a basic summary of Alexander's conquest of the Persians. Later in the chapter, we are told that the horn is broken (a reference to Alexander's death) and four horns appear in its place (a reference to the four rulers that divided up Alexander's kingdom).<sup id="cite_ref-Guzik_33-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Guzik-33">[33]</a></sup> This again provides further evidence that the ram is not Cyrus, as Alexander lived three centuries after Cyrus and the two never fought each other on the battle field.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Building_a_Wall">Building a Wall</span></h3>
<p>We have no evidence that Cyrus the Great built large walls or was famous for such deeds. In his commentary, Maududi all but admits as much:
</p>
<div class="quotes">As regards Gog and Magog, it has been nearly established that they were the wild tribes of Central Asia who were known by different names: Tartars, Mongols, Huns and Scythians, who 'had been making inroads on settled kingdoms and empires from very ancient times. It is also known that strong bulwarks had been built in southern regions of Caucasia, though <b>it has not been as yet historically established that these were built by Cyrus</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-Maududi18_31-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-Maududi18-31">[31]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Tafhim al-Qur'an, Introduction to Chapter 18</div></div>
<p>When we compare this to the legendary version of Alexander, who not only built a wall against Gog and Magog but made it of iron and bronze, we have the final piece of evidence that the Legendary Alexander is the person identified as Dhul-Qarnayn in the Qur'an and not Cyrus.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Historicity_of_the_Story">Historicity of the Story</span></h2>
<p>Another problem for apologists is the complete lack of physical evidence for the existence of this massive wall of iron and bronze that Dhul-Qarnayn supposedly built at the end of his final journey. If this story is historically accurate then they should be able to point to the location of this large wall, between two mountains that is holding back a tribe of people bent on destroying the earth.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_Claims_in_the_Hadith">Historical Claims in the Hadith</span></h3>
<p>The historical nature of the story is affirmed by the following Sahih Hadith by Bukhari which relates that Muhammad viewed this wall (here called a dam) holding back Gog and Magog as a real structure that was facing immanent demise. In this account, he also reiterates that the wall's destruction will bring about death and destruction of the land when the tribes held behind it are let loose.

Shall we be destroyed though there will be righteous people among us?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Yes, if the (number) of evil (persons) increased.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/088-sbt.php#009.088.249#009.088.249">9:88:249</a></div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Great_Wall_of_Gorgan">Great Wall of Gorgan</span></h3>
<p>The Great Wall of Gorgan is sometimes offered as a possible candidate for the wall built by Dhul-Qarnayn. Made of clay from the local soil, the wall is called the Red Snake due to the color of its bricks. The wall is 195 km (121 mi) long and interspersed with forts. It covers an area between the Caspian Sea and the mountains of northeastern Iran. Dr. Kiani, who led an archaeological team in 1971, believed that the wall was built during the Parthian Empire (247 BCE–224 CE), and that it was restored during the Sassanid era (3<sup>rd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> century CE).<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>
</p><p>This wall cannot be same as the one described in the story of Dhul-Qarnayn for a number of reasons. First, it is made of bricks not iron and brass. It also does not cover an area between two mountains. The story in the Qur'an says that the wall built by Dhul-Qarnayn holds back a tribe but this wall in northern Iran is not holding back anyone; it is in a state of disrepair.  The Qur'an also says the wall of iron will not be destroyed until the Day of Judgement; unless apologists are willing to admit that this Qur'anic prophecy has failed, then this cannot be the wall described in Surat 18. Finally, even its earliest dating of 247 BC puts it almost three centuries after the reign of Cyrus the Great (576–530 BC) and almost a century after Alexander the Great (356–323 BC).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Caspian_Gates_of_Derbent">Caspian Gates of Derbent</span></h3>
<p>Derbent, a city on the other side of the Caspian Sea from the Great Wall of Gorgon is located just north of the Azerbaijani border. Historically, it occupied one of the few passages through the Caucus mountains and it has often been identified with the word 'gate'. Fortresses and walls have been built at this location probably dating back thousands of years. The historical Caspian Gates were not built until the reign of Khosrau I in the 6<sup>th</sup> century, long after Alexander, but they likely were attributed to him in the following centuries. The immense wall had a height of up to twenty meters and a thickness of about 3 meters when it was in use.
</p><p>This wall cannot be the same as the one in the Qur'an because it is not built between two mountains. The walls near Derbent were built with the Caspian sea as one border. In his comments on Derbent, Yusuf Ali mentions, that &quot;there is no iron gate there now, but there was one in the seventh century, when the Chinese traveler Hiouen Tsiang saw it on his journey to India. He saw two folding gates cased with iron hung with bells&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-YusufAli_20-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Dhul-Qarnayn_and_the_Alexander_Romance.html#cite_note-YusufAli-20">[20]</a></sup> Again, if this gate is the same as the one in the Qur'anic story then the apologist must admit that the revelation of the gate holding back Gog and Magog must have failed since they did not rampage over the nations nor bring about judgement day. Additionally, the solitary claim of a single eye witness from the 7<sup>th</sup> century is spurious at best. We should expect a massive structure would have left copious amounts of archaeological evidence, instead all we have are rumors and folktales.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>In summary, the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence supports that:
</p>
<ul><li> The story in the Qur'an parallels a medieval Syriac legend of Alexander; it portrays him as a believing king who traveled the world and built a barrier of iron which holds back the tribes of Gog and Magog until Judgement Day.</li>
<li> Almost every major element of the Qur'anic story can be found in Christian and Jewish folklore that dates hundreds of years prior to the time of Prophet Muhammad.</li>
<li> Most early Muslim commentators and scholars identified Dhul-Qarnayn as Alexander the Great, and some modern ones do too.</li>
<li> Historical and Archaeological evidence has revealed that the real Alexander was a polytheistic pagan who believed he was the literal son of Greek and Egyptian gods.</li>
<li> The theory that Dhul-Qarnayn is Cyrus the Great has little evidence in its favor compared to the overwhelming evidence that the story is actually based on a legendary version of Alexander.</li>
<li> Today, there is no giant wall of iron and brass between two mountains that is holding back a tribe of people; it likely never existed.</li></ul>
<p>From all of this it can be concluded that the story of Dhul-Qarnayn is a myth about Alexander the Great and has no basis in history.
