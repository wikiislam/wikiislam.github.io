</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:2"> <sup>2</sup></span> (He hath made it) Straight (and Clear) in order that He may warn (the godless) of a terrible Punishment from Him, and that He may give Glad Tidings to the Believers who work righteous deeds, that they shall have a goodly Reward,

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:5"> <sup>5</sup></span> No knowledge have they of such a thing, nor had their fathers. It is a grievous thing that issues from their mouths as a saying what they say is nothing but falsehood!

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:11"> <sup>11</sup></span> Then We draw (a veil) over their ears, for a number of years, in the Cave, (so that they heard not):
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:12"> <sup>12</sup></span> Then We roused them, in order to test which of the two parties was best at calculating the term of years they had tarried!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:13"> <sup>13</sup></span> We relate to thee their story in truth: they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We advanced them in guidance:
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:14"> <sup>14</sup></span> We gave strength to their hearts: Behold, they stood up and said: &quot;Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth: never shall we call upon any god other than Him; if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:15"> <sup>15</sup></span> &quot;These our people have taken for worship, gods other than Him: why do they not bring forward an authority clear (and convincing) for what they do? Who doth more wrong than such as invent a falsehood against Allah?
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="18:16"> <sup>16</sup></span> &quot;When ye turn away from them and the things they worship other than Allah, betake yourselves to the Cave: Your Lord will shower His mercies on you and disposes of your affair towards comfort and ease.&quot;
