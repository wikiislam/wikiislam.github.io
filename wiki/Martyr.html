<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Islamic_Definition">Islamic Definition</span></h2>
<p>Although the accepted definition of the martyr is also applied to Muslims as in the case of Sumayah, the mother of ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Martyr.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Muslims soldiers who die while engaging in jihad are also considered martyrs in Islam.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Jurists have given the technical definition of a martyr as follows: 
<p>According to the Hanafis: 
</p><p>&quot;One who is killed by the pagans, or is found killed in the battle bearing a mark of any wound, whether external or internal - such as blood emerging from an eye or the like.&quot; [Al-`Inayah published on the margins of Fath al-Qadeer (2/142) and Hashiyat Ibn `Abideen (2/268)] 
</p><p>&quot;Anyone who is killed while fighting pagans, or rebels, or brigands, by a means attributed to the enemy - whether directly or by consequence - is a shaheed, anyone who is killed by a means not specifically attributed to [an action of] the enemy is not considered a shaheed.&quot; [Zayla`i's Tabyeen al-Haqa'iq, (1/247). See also Al-Bahr al-Ra'iq (2/211)] 
</p><p>According to the Malikis: 
</p><p>&quot;One who is killed while fighting warring unbelievers only, even if killed on Islamic land such as if the enemy attacked the Muslims, [even if he] did not fight on account of being unaware or asleep, [and even if] killed by a Muslim who mistook him for an unbeliever, or trampled by a horse, or mistakenly smitten by his own sword or arrow, or by having fallen into a well or from a cliff during the fighting.&quot; [Dardeer's Al-Sharh al-Kabeer, (1/425)] 
</p><p>According to the Shafi`is: 
</p><p>&quot;One who is killed in fighting unbelievers, facing and not running away, for the raising of Allah's word…and not for any worldly motive.&quot; [Mughni al-Muhtaj (1/350) and see Fath al-Bari (6/129)] 
</p><p>According to the Hanbalis: 
</p>
&quot;One who dies in a battle with the unbelievers, whether male or female, adult or not, whether killed by the unbelievers, or by his own weapon in error, or by having fallen off his mount, or having been found dead with no mark, provided he was sincere.&quot; [Kash-shaf al-Qina`, 2/113.

<p>This is a classic example of the use of <a href="wiki/Doublespeak.html" title="Doublespeak">doublespeak</a>.  By using the word &quot;martyr&quot; when describing Muslim warriors, the reader (or listener) is deceived in believing that the person was murdered for their faith rather than someone who was killed while actively engaging in violence and warfare.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Abu Huraira: 
The Prophet said, &quot;The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). Had I not found it difficult for my followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah's cause and then made alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred in His cause.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/002-sbt.php#001.002.035#001.002.035">1:2:35</a></div></div>

<p>In addition to being killed while actively engaging in violence and warfare, here <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> adds another way for someone to become a martyr:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As:

<div class="quotes"><b>Martyrdom Operations</b> - sometimes called Fidayee attacks (see Note 1) - are those where a Muslim, a Mujahid, attacks the enemy in such a way that the death of that Muslim is (should Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala) so will it) highly likely. The history of Islam is replete with heroes who have sacrificed their own life for the Way of Life which is Al-Islam.*

</p><p>Not surprisingly, such attacks are feared by the enemies of Islam, and especially by those infidels who are waging war against Islam, those who are oppressing Muslims, and those who are invading Muslim lands.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fatwas">Fatwas</span></h3>
<p>Below is a fatwa issued by Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, discussing the reasons why even women are permitted to participate in &quot;Martyr Operations&quot;.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Women’s participation in the martyr operations carried out in Palestine – given the status of the land as an occupied territory, in addition to a lot of sacrilegious acts perpetrated by the Jews against the sanctuaries – is one of the most praised acts of worship. Also, the act is a form of martyrdom in the Cause of Allah, and it entitles them, Insha’ Allah, to the same reward earned by their male counterparts who also die in the Cause of Allah.<br>. . .<br>
<p>The martyr operations is the greatest of all sorts of Jihad in the Cause of Allah. A martyr operation is carried out by a person who sacrifices himself, deeming his life less value than striving in the Cause of Allah, in the cause of restoring the land and preserving the dignity. To such a valorous attitude applies the following Qur’anic verse: “And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah; and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen.” (Al-Baqarah: 207)
</p><p><b>But a clear distinction has to be made here between martyrdom and suicide. Suicide is an act or instance of killing oneself intentionally out of despair, and finding no outlet except putting an end to one’s life. On the other hand, martyrdom is a heroic act of choosing to suffer death in the Cause of Allah, and that’s why it’s considered by most Muslim scholars as one of the greatest forms of Jihad.</b><br>. . .<br>
</p>
In the same vein, the public welfare should be given priority to the personal one, in the sense that if there is a contradiction between the private right and the public one, the latter must be given first priority for it concerns the interest of the whole Ummah. Given all this, I believe a woman can participate in this form of Jihad according to her own means and condition. Also, the organizers of these martyr operations can benefit from some believing women as they may do, in some cases, what is impossible for men to do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545134?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545134">Palestinian Women Carrying Out Martyr Operations</a><br>Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Islam Online, November 6, 2006</div></div>
<p>Here is another excerpt taken from a longer fatwa (fifteen pages in length) by Muslim scholar Sheikh al-Uyayri, explaining in depth why suicide bombings and killing of civilians (including Muslims) via the use of them as &quot;human shields&quot; is permissible in Islam. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">We have arrived at the conclusion that martyrdom operations are permissible, and in fact <b>the Mujahid who is killed in them is better than one who is killed fighting in the ranks</b>, for there are gradations even among martyrs, corresponding to their role, action effort and risk undertaken. Then, we explained how martyrdom operations are the least costly to the Mujahideen and most detrimental to the enemy. We have heard, as you must have, that <b>most scholars today permit such operations; at least 30 Fatawa have been issued to this effect</b>. We explained how this issue is derived from the issue of plunging single-handedly into the enemy ranks; something which is praiseworthy by the agreement of jurists. We then further stated that we preferred the view that such an action is permissible even if martyrdom is the only goal, although it is certainly not the optimal practice. Martyrdom operations should not be carried out unless certain conditions are met:
<p>1. One's intention is sincere and pure - to raise the Word of Allah. <br>
2. One is reasonably sure that the desired effect cannot be achieved by any other means which would guarantee preservation of his life. <br>
3. One is reasonably sure that loss will be inflicted on the enemy, or they will be frightened, or the Muslims will be emboldened. <br>
4. One should consult with war strategy experts, and especially with the amber of war, for otherwise he may upset plan and alert the enemy to their presence.
</p><p>If the first condition is absent, the deed is worthless, but if it is satisfied while some others are lacking, then it is not the best thing, but this does not necessarily mean the Mujahid is not shaheed.
</p>
<b>We also explained how causing a death carries the same verdict as actual killing. Hence one who plunges without armour into the enemy ranks, being certain of death, just like one who engages in a martyrdom operation, is effectively causing his own death, but they are praiseworthy because of the circumstances and intention, and hence are not considered to have committed suicide.</b> We also clarified that [according to the majority] the identity of the killer does not have an effect on whether the Mujahid will be considered shaheed. This dispels the wavering arising from the fact that the Mujahid is taking his own life. Thus, such operations could take on any of the five Shar`i verdicts depending on intention and circumstances. Finally, we clarified that taking one's own life is not always blameworthy; rather it is contingent on the motives behind it. So, we conclude that one who kills himself because of his strong faith and out of love for Allah and the Prophet, and in the interests of the religion, is praiseworthy.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_Islamic_Ruling_on_the_Permissibility_of_Martyrdom_Operations.html" title="The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations">The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations</a><br>Sheikh al-Uyayri</div></div>
