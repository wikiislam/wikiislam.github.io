<p>These verses call Muslims to &quot;Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.&quot; (<a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.029#009.029">9:29</a>)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Qur.27an">Qur'an</span></h2>
<p>The following verses are taken from Surah 9, <a href="wiki/Chronological_Order_of_the_Qur'an.html" title="Chronological Order of the Qur'an">which is one of the very last chapters of the Quran</a> to be revealed by Muhammad. Consequently, these newer verses abrogate all of the previous less aggressive verses that conflict with them. The following lists, without interruption, the most important verses that command Jihad against all unsubdued non-Muslims.
</p><p>Muslims are not required to keep treaties with pagans who have not upheld their part of the treaty, and Muslims are to give those pagans four months notice. However Muslims are required to keep treaties with those pagans who have upheld their part of the treaty until the end of the agreed upon time. After the treaties have expired Muslims are to make no more treaties with pagans and they are to subdue or kill those who do not accept Islam.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Freedom from obligation (is proclaimed) from Allah and His messenger toward those of the idolaters with whom ye made a treaty.<br><br>
<p>Travel freely in the land four months, and know that ye cannot escape Allah and that Allah will confound the disbelievers (in His Guidance).<br><br>
And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith.<br><br>
Excepting those of the idolaters with whom ye (Muslims) have a treaty, and who have since abated nothing of your right nor have supported anyone against you. (As for these), <i>fulfil their treaty to them <b>till their term.</b></i> Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty (unto Him). <br><br>
</p>
<b>Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters <i>wherever ye find them</i>, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if</b> they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.001#009.001">9:1-5</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">And if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection (O Muhammad), then protect him so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and afterward convey him to his place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not.<br><br>
<p>How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the Inviolable Place of Worship? So long as they are true to you, be true to them. Lo! Allah loveth those who keep their duty.<br><br>
How (can there be any treaty for the others) when, if they have the upper hand of you, they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you? They satisfy you with their mouths the while their hearts refuse. And most of them are wrongdoers.<br><br>
They have purchased with the revelations of Allah a little gain, so they debar (men) from His way. Lo! evil is that which they are wont to do.<br><br>
</p>
And they observe toward a believer neither pact nor honour. These are they who are transgressors.<br><br><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.006#009.006">9:6-10</a></div></div>
<p>Any pagans that accept Islam become brothers in the faith, but if they apostatize then you are to fight them.
</p>
<div class="quotes">But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge.<br><br>
<p><i>And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief</i> - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist.<br><br>
Will ye not fight a folk who broke their solemn pledges, and purposed to drive out the messenger and did attack you first? What! Fear ye them? Now Allah hath more right that ye should fear Him, if ye are believers<br><br>
<i>Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them,</i> and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers.<br><br>
</p>
And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah relenteth toward whom He will. Allah is Knower, Wise.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.011#009.011">9:11-15</a></div></div>
<p>Allah knows who truly strives for him and do not befriend non-Muslims or seek protection from them. Only Muslims are to tend to Allah's sanctuaries (This was one of the reasons that Muhammad declared war on the Meccans).
</p>
<div class="quotes">Or deemed ye that ye would be left (in peace) when Allah yet knoweth not those of you who strive, <b>choosing for familiar none save Allah and His messenger and the believers</b>? Allah is Informed of what ye do.<br><br>
<p>It is not for the idolaters to tend Allah's sanctuaries, bearing witness against themselves of disbelief. As for such, their works are vain and in the Fire they will abide.<br><br>
</p>
He only shall tend Allah's sanctuaries who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due and feareth none save Allah. For such (only) is it possible that they can be of the rightly guided. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.016#009.016">9:16-18</a></div></div>
<p>Jihad is the greatest of all acts that can be done for Allah.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque, equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive with might and main in the cause of Allah? They are not comparable in the sight of Allah: and Allah guides not those who do wrong.<br><br>
<p>Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.<br><br>
</p>
Their Lord giveth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and Gardens where enduring pleasure will be theirs;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.019#009.019">9:19-21</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">There they will abide for ever. Lo! with Allah there is immense reward.<br><br>
<p>O ye who believe! Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers.<br><br>
</p>
Say: If your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your tribe, and the wealth ye have acquired, and merchandise for which ye fear that there will no sale, and dwellings ye desire are dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striving in His way: then wait till Allah bringeth His command to pass. Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.022#009.022">9:22-24</a></div></div>
<p>Referring to the battle of Hunain that occurred on January 31, 630 A.D.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you vain, but they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its spaciousness, then you turned back retreating.<br><br>
<p>Then Allah sent His peace of reassurance down upon His messenger and upon the believers, and sent down hosts ye could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such is the reward of disbelievers.<br><br>
</p>
Then afterward Allah will relent toward whom He will; for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.025#009.025">9:25-27</a></div></div>
<p>Forbid pagans from entering the Ka'aba.

<p>Fight non-Muslims, even Christians and Jews, until they are subdued. Fight the Christians and Jews until they submit because they have corrupted Allah's teachings and they are corrupt.

<div class="quotes"><i><b>Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.</b></i><br><br>
<p>And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved of old. Allah (Himself) fighteth against them. How perverse are they!<br><br>
They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One Allah. There is no Allah save Him. Be He Glorified from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)!<br><br>
Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah disdaineth (aught) save that He shall perfect His light, however much the disbelievers are averse.<br><br>
He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolaters may be averse.<br><br>
O ye who believe! Lo! many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks devour the wealth of mankind wantonly and debar (men) from the way of Allah. They who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah, unto them give tidings (O Muhammad) of a painful doom,<br><br>

On the day when it will (all) be heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads and their flanks and their backs will be branded therewith (and it will be said unto them): Here is that which ye hoarded for yourselves.

<p><b>If ye go not forth He will afflict you with a painful doom</b>, and will choose instead of you a folk other than you. Ye cannot harm Him at all. Allah is Able to do all things.<br><br>
If ye help him not, still Allah helped him when those who disbelieve drove him forth, the second of two; when they two were in the cave, when he said unto his comrade: Grieve not. Lo! Allah is with us. Then Allah caused His peace of reassurance to descend upon him and supported him with hosts ye cannot see, and made the word of those who disbelieved the nethermost, while Allah's Word it was that became the uppermost.

<p>Those Muslims who are unable to fight for Allah are not required to fight and are forgiven by Allah, but those Muslims who are able to fight but don't want to fight are not forgiven by Allah.

<div class="quotes">Those who were left behind (in the Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the Messenger of Allah: they hated to strive and fight, with their goods and their persons, in the cause of Allah: they said, &quot;Go not forth in the heat.&quot; Say, &quot;The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat.&quot; If only they could understand!<br><br>
<p>Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the (evil) that they do.<br><br>
If, then, Allah bring thee back to any of them, and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee), say: &quot;Never shall ye come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sit ye (now) with those who lag behind.&quot;<br><br>
Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; for they rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died in a state of perverse rebellion.<br><br>
Nor let their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: Allah's plan is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.<br><br>
When a Sura comes down, enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive and fight along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption, and say: &quot;Leave us (behind): we would be with those who sit (at home).&quot;<br><br> 
</p><p>They prefer to be with (the women), who remain behind (at home): their hearts are sealed and so they understand not.<br><br>
But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.<br><br>
Allah hath prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein: that is the supreme felicity.<br><br>
And there were, among the desert Arabs (also), men who made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger (merely) sat inactive. Soon will a grievous penalty seize the Unbelievers among them.<br><br>
There is no blame on those who are infirm, or ill, or who find no resources to spend (on the cause), if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger: no ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right: and Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.<br><br>
Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts, and when thou saidst, &quot;I can find no mounts for you,&quot; they turned back, their eyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith to provide the expenses.<br><br>
The ground (of complaint) is against such as claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with the (women) who remain behind: Allah hath sealed their hearts; so they know not (What they miss).<br><br>
They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou: &quot;Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that Allah and His Messenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.&quot;<br><br>
They will swear to you by Allah, when ye return to them, that ye may leave them alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination, and Hell is their dwelling-place,-a fitting recompense for the (evil) that they did.<br><br>
</p>
They will swear unto you, that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them, Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/009-qmt.php#009.081#009.081">9:81-96</a></div></div>

Have you not considered the chiefs of the children of Israel after Musa, when they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up for us a king, (that) we may fight in the way of Allah.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Did he profess&quot; There is no god but Allah,&quot; and even then you killed him? I said: Messenger of Allah, he made a profession of it out of the fear of the weapon. He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Did you tear his heart in order to find out whether it had professed or not? And he went on repeating it to me till I wished I had embraced Islam that day. Sa'd said: By Allah, I would never kill any Muslim so long as a person with a heavy belly, i. e., Usama, would not kill.

<div class="quotes">It has been reported from Sulaiman b.

He would say: <b>Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah.</b> Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them. When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah's Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah's behest with regard to them.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/019-smt.php#019.4294#019.4294">19:4294</a></div></div>
