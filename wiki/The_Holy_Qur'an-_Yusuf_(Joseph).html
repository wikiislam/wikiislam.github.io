</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:2"> <sup>2</sup></span> We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur'an, in order that ye may learn wisdom.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:3"> <sup>3</sup></span> We do relate unto thee the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal to thee this (portion of the) Qur'an: before this, thou too was among those who knew it not.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:4"> <sup>4</sup></span> Behold! Joseph said to his father: &quot;O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:5"> <sup>5</sup></span> Said (the father): &quot;My (dear) little son! relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is to man an avowed enemy!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:6"> <sup>6</sup></span> &quot;Thus will thy Lord choose thee and teach thee the interpretation of stories (and events) and perfect His favour to thee and to the posterity of Jacob - even as He perfected it to thy fathers Abraham and Isaac aforetime! for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:7"> <sup>7</sup></span> Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (or symbols) for seekers (after Truth).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:8"> <sup>8</sup></span> They said: &quot;Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we: But we are a goodly body! Really our father is obviously wandering (in his mind)!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:9"> <sup>9</sup></span> &quot;Slay ye Joseph or cast him out to some (unknown) land, that so the favour of your father may be given to you alone: (there will be time enough) for you to be righteous after that!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:10"> <sup>10</sup></span> Said one of them: &quot;Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travelers.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:11"> <sup>11</sup></span> They said: &quot;O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph, seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:12"> <sup>12</sup></span> &quot;Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:13"> <sup>13</sup></span> (Jacob) said: &quot;Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:14"> <sup>14</sup></span> They said: &quot;If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:15"> <sup>15</sup></span> So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): 'Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not'
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:16"> <sup>16</sup></span> Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:17"> <sup>17</sup></span> They said: &quot;O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him... But thou wilt never believe us even though we tell the truth.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:18"> <sup>18</sup></span> They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: &quot;Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is Allah (alone) Whose help can be sought.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:19"> <sup>19</sup></span> Then there came a caravan of travelers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well)... He said: &quot;Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!&quot; So they concealed him as a treasure! But Allah knoweth well all that they do!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:20"> <sup>20</sup></span> The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:21"> <sup>21</sup></span> The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: &quot;Make his stay (among us) honourable: may be he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son.&quot; Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:22"> <sup>22</sup></span> When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:23"> <sup>23</sup></span> But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: &quot;Now come, thou (dear one)!&quot; He said: &quot;(Allah) forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:24"> <sup>24</sup></span> And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:25"> <sup>25</sup></span> So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back: they both found her lord near the door.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:26"> <sup>26</sup></span> He said: &quot;It was she that sought to seduce me - from my (true) self.&quot; And one of her household saw (this) and bore witness, (thus):- &quot;If it be that his shirt is rent from the front, then is her tale true, and he is a liar!

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:29"> <sup>29</sup></span> &quot;O Joseph, pass this over! (O wife), ask forgiveness for thy sin, for truly thou hast been at fault!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:30"> <sup>30</sup></span> Ladies said in the City: &quot;The wife of the (great) 'Aziz is seeking to seduce her slave from his (true) self: Truly hath he inspired her with violent love: we see she is evidently going astray.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:31"> <sup>31</sup></span> When she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them: she gave each of them a knife: and she said (to Joseph), &quot;Come out before them.&quot; When they saw him, they did extol him, and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said, &quot;(Allah) preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none other than a noble angel!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:32"> <sup>32</sup></span> She said: &quot;There before you is the man about whom ye did blame me!

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:33"> <sup>33</sup></span> He said: &quot;O my Lord! the prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me: Unless Thou turn away their snare from me, I should (in my youthful folly) feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:34"> <sup>34</sup></span> So his Lord hearkened to him (in his prayer), and turned away from him their snare: Verily He heareth and knoweth (all things).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:35"> <sup>35</sup></span> Then it occurred to the men, after they had seen the signs, (that it was best) to imprison him for a time.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:36"> <sup>36</sup></span> Now with him there came into the prison two young men.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:37"> <sup>37</sup></span> He said: &quot;Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:38"> <sup>38</sup></span> &quot;And I follow the ways of my fathers: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and never could we attribute any partners whatever to Allah. That (comes) of the grace of Allah to us and to mankind: yet most men are not grateful.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:40"> <sup>40</sup></span> &quot;If not Him, ye worship nothing but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath sent down no authority: the command is for none but Allah.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:41"> <sup>41</sup></span> &quot;O my two companions of the prison!

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:42"> <sup>42</sup></span> And of the two, to that one whom he consider about to be saved, he said: &quot;Mention me to thy lord.&quot; But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord: and (Joseph) lingered in prison a few (more) years.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:43"> <sup>43</sup></span> The king (of Egypt) said: &quot;I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:44"> <sup>44</sup></span> They said: &quot;A confused medley of dreams: and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:45"> <sup>45</sup></span> But the man who had been released, one of the two (who had been in prison) and who now bethought him after (so long) a space of time, said: &quot;I will tell you the truth of its interpretation: send ye me (therefore).&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:46"> <sup>46</sup></span> &quot;O Joseph!&quot; (he said) &quot;O man of truth!

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:47"> <sup>47</sup></span> (Joseph) said: &quot;For seven years shall ye diligently sow as is your wont: and the harvests that ye reap, ye shall leave them in the ear, except a little, of which ye shall eat.

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:50"> <sup>50</sup></span> So the king said: &quot;Bring ye him unto me.&quot; But when the messenger came to him, (Joseph) said: &quot;Go thou back to thy lord, and ask him, 'What is the state of mind of the ladies who cut their hands?' For my Lord is certainly well aware of their snare.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:51"> <sup>51</sup></span> (The king) said (to the ladies): &quot;What was your affair when ye did seek to seduce Joseph from his (true) self?&quot; The ladies said: &quot;(Allah) preserve us! no evil know we against him!&quot; Said the 'Aziz's wife: &quot;Now is the truth manifest (to all): it was I who sought to seduce him from his (true) self: He is indeed of those who are (ever) true (and virtuous).
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:52"> <sup>52</sup></span> &quot;This (say I), in order that He may know that I have never been false to him in his absence, and that Allah will never guide the snare of the false ones.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:53"> <sup>53</sup></span> &quot;Nor do I absolve my own self (of blame): the (human) soul is certainly prone to evil, unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely my Lord is Oft- forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:54"> <sup>54</sup></span> So the king said: &quot;Bring him unto me; I will take him specially to serve about my own person.&quot; Therefore when he had spoken to him, he said: &quot;Be assured this day, thou art, before our own presence, with rank firmly established, and fidelity fully proved!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:55"> <sup>55</sup></span> (Joseph) said: &quot;Set me over the store-houses of the land: I will indeed guard them, as one that knows (their importance).&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:56"> <sup>56</sup></span> Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possession therein as, when, or where he pleased. We bestow of our Mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not, to be lost, the reward of those who do good.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:57"> <sup>57</sup></span> But verily the reward of the Hereafter is the best, for those who believe, and are constant in righteousness.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:58"> <sup>58</sup></span> Then came Joseph's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them, but they knew him not.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:59"> <sup>59</sup></span> And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he said: &quot;Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves, (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that I do provide the best hospitality?
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:60"> <sup>60</sup></span> &quot;Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall ye (even) come near me.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:61"> <sup>61</sup></span> They said: &quot;We shall certainly seek to get our wish about him from his father: Indeed we shall do it.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:62"> <sup>62</sup></span> And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they had bartered) into their saddle-bags, so they should know it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might come back.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:63"> <sup>63</sup></span> Now when they returned to their father, they said: &quot;O our father! No more measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every care of him.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:64"> <sup>64</sup></span> He said: &quot;Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted you with his brother aforetime? But Allah is the best to take care (of him), and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:65"> <sup>65</sup></span> Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had been returned to them. They said: &quot;O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel's load (of grain to our provisions). This is but a small quantity.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:66"> <sup>66</sup></span> (Jacob) said: &quot;Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath to me, in Allah's name, that ye will be sure to bring him back to me unless ye are yourselves hemmed in (and made powerless). And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: &quot;Over all that we say, be Allah the witness and guardian!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:67"> <sup>67</sup></span> Further he said: &quot;O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah. On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:68"> <sup>68</sup></span> And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah. It was but a necessity of Jacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:69"> <sup>69</sup></span> Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother to stay with him. He said (to him): &quot;Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught of their doings.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:70"> <sup>70</sup></span> At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag. Then shouted out a crier: &quot;O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves, without doubt!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:71"> <sup>71</sup></span> They said, turning towards them: &quot;What is it that ye miss?&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:72"> <sup>72</sup></span> They said: &quot;We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:73"> <sup>73</sup></span> (The brothers) said: &quot;By Allah. Well ye know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are no thieves!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:74"> <sup>74</sup></span> (The Egyptians) said: &quot;What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are (proved) to have lied?&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:75"> <sup>75</sup></span> They said: &quot;The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found, should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime). Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:76"> <sup>76</sup></span> So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah willed it (so). We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with knowledge is one, the All-Knowing.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:77"> <sup>77</sup></span> They said: &quot;If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before (him).&quot; But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing not the secrets to them. He (simply) said (to himself): &quot;Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth best the truth of what ye assert!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:78"> <sup>78</sup></span> They said: &quot;O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable, (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that thou art (gracious) in doing good.&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:79"> <sup>79</sup></span> He said: &quot;(Allah) forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:80"> <sup>80</sup></span> Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private. The leader among them said: &quot;Know ye not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:81"> <sup>81</sup></span> &quot;Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy son committed theft! we bear witness only to what we know, and we could not well guard against the unseen!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:82"> <sup>82</sup></span> &quot;'Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned, and (you will find) we are indeed telling the truth.'&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:83"> <sup>83</sup></span> Jacob said: &quot;Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough) for you. So patience is most fitting (for me).

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:84"> <sup>84</sup></span> And he turned away from them, and said: &quot;How great is my grief for Joseph!&quot; And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:85"> <sup>85</sup></span> They said: &quot;By Allah. (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:86"> <sup>86</sup></span> He said: &quot;I only complain of my distraction and anguish to Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not...

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="12:91"> <sup>91</sup></span> They said: &quot;By Allah, Indeed has Allah preferred thee above us, and we certainly have been guilty of sin!&quot;
