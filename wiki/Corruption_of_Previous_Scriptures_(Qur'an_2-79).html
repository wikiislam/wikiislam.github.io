<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>While early Islamic scholars such as Ibn al-Layth, Ibn Rabban, Ibn Qutayba, Al-Ya'qubi, Al-Tabari, Al-Baqillani, Al-Mas'udi, and Al-Bukhari would disagree,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_Previous_Scriptures_(Qur'an_2-79).html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_Previous_Scriptures_(Qur'an_2-79).html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> today it is a common belief among Muslims that the Qur'an states that the previous scriptures (the Taurat and Injil) have been physically corrupted by those who were charged with safeguarding it (the Jews and Christians). Thus, the Qur'an is the 'return' to the true message of the God of the Bible. When asked to provide evidence that the Qur'an says the previous scriptures have been corrupted, <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> will present <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.079#002.079">2:79</a> as evidence.

<p><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:&quot;This is from Allah,&quot; to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby.
</p><p><b>Pickthal:</b> Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say, &quot;This is from Allah,&quot; that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn thereby.

<p>Does this verse alone prove the corruption of previous scriptures? Let us examine what the Qur'an<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Corruption_of_Previous_Scriptures_(Qur'an_2-79).html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> really says about the Taurat and Injil; and examine <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.079#002.079">2:79</a> in its own context, as well as against the aforementioned verses to see if the belief of physical scriptural corruption is valid.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_the_Qur.27an_says_about_corruption">What the Qur'an says about corruption</span></h2>
<p>We will start by looking at verses of the Qur'an that talk about the corruption of the previous scriptures
</p>
<div class="quotes">But those who were unjust changed it for a saying other than that which had been spoken to them, so We sent upon those who were unjust a pestilence from heaven, because they transgressed.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.059#002.059">2:59</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Do you then hope that they would believe in you, <b>and a party from among them indeed used to hear the Word of Allah, then altered it after they had understood it, and they know (this).</b> And when they meet those who believe they say: We believe, and when they are alone one with another they say: Do you talk to them of what Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this before your Lord? Do you not then understand? <b>Do they not know that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known?</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.075#002.075">2:75-77</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Nay! do you say that Ibrahim and Ismail and Yaqoub and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Are you better knowing or Allah? And who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from Allah? And Allah is not at all heedless of what you do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.140#002.140">2:140</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">(As for) those who take a small price for the covenant of Allah and their own oaths-- surely they shall have no portion in the hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look upon them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement. <b>Most surely there is a party amongst those who distort the Book with their tongue that you may consider it to be (a part) of the Book, and they say, It is from Allah, while it is not from Allah, and they tell a lie against Allah whilst they know.</b> It is not meet for a mortal that Allah should give him the Book and the wisdom and prophethood, then he should say to men: Be my servants rather than Allah's; but rather (he would say): Be worshipers of the Lord <b>because of your teaching the Book and your reading (it yourselves).</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/003-qmt.php#003.077#003.077">3:77-79</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">And when Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: You shall certainly make it known to men and you shall not hide it; but they cast it behind their backs and took a small price for it; so evil is that which they buy.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/003-qmt.php#003.187#003.187">3:187</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words from their places and say: We have heard and we disobey and: Hear, may you not be made to hear! and: Raina, distorting (the word) with their tongues and taunting about religion; and if they had said (instead): We have heard and we obey, and hearken, and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief, so they do not believe but a little.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.046#004.046">4:46</a></div></div>

And with those who say, We are Christians, We made a covenant, <b>but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of</b>, therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred to the day of resurrection; and Allah will inform them of what they did. O followers of the Book! indeed Our Messenger has come to you making clear to you <b>much of what you concealed of the Book and passing over much</b>; indeed, there has come to you light and a clear Book from Allah;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.013#005.013">5:13-15</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">O Messenger! let not those grieve you who strive together in hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their mouths: We believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews; they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners for another people who have not come to you; <b>they alter the words from their places, saying: If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious</b>; and as for him whose temptation Allah desires, you cannot control anything for him with Allah. Those are they for whom Allah does not desire that He should purify their hearts; they shall have disgrace in this world, and they shall have a grievous chastisement in the hereafter.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/005-qmt.php#005.041#005.041">5:41</a></div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis">Analysis</span></h3>
<p>The first thing to note when reading through these verses is the wording used. Nowhere in the above verses does it say that the Jews or Christians wrote down, in their holy books,  what was not revealed from Allah:

<p>So far, we see that the Qur'an <i>does</i> charge that the Jews and Christian's corrupted their scriptures; but only in their oral recitations. Qur'an 2:77 charges that the Jews deliberately &quot;keep secret&quot; parts of their Taurat from the people who do not know the Jewish scriptures. If the physical scriptures have been corrupted, how would the Jews know what was supposed to be in it? Are we to believe that there are 'original' Taurat's lying around somewhere for the Jews to compare to; or is there a special Jewish school or class where they learn about what was 'omitted' from the Taurat? Who were the Jews keeping 'secrets' about their texts from? Other Jews? Why? We know the Jews are literate people because they 'knew what their book said but hid it behind their backs.' Were they keeping the information from the illiterate people (like Muhammad)? This would fit with the Qur'an's charge that the Jews 'distorted the book with their tongues.'
</p><p>The Jews 'altered the words from their places' and 'forgot a good part of the message'; this also does not speak to physical scriptural corruption, but (alleged) corruption in their recitations to those who did not know the Jewish scriptures. Consider the claims made in Qur'an 5:15. it alleges that Muhammad 'made clear' what the Jews had 'concealed'; Muhammad also made clear that which they had 'passed over.' If the actual text was corrupt, how could the Jews have 'passed over' it? Surely if the physical corruption claim is true, the Qur'an should be using words like &quot;the parts that the Jews removed from their books&quot; or &quot;the parts which have been omitted.&quot;
</p><p>We see no such wording in the language of the Qur'an; only evidence that Muhammad thought the Jews were lying about what was written in their Taurat, in order to reject him as a prophet of their God.

<p>From the above verses we can see that the Qur'an confirms that the Jews and Christians had <i>intact</i> scriptures at the time of Muhammad. They <i>have</i> the book with Allah's judgment in it (the Taurat). Some Muslims claim that parts of it are Allah's book and parts are not. 
</p>
<ul><li>If you write a thesis and someone copies it; omitting parts and adding other parts in there. It is no longer your thesis but a bastardization of your thesis. Would you then say &quot;yes, that's my thesis!&quot; or would you say &quot;parts of that are mine but these parts are not&quot;? Certainly if you were talking about it, you would state that it was no longer your thesis because the words are changed. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Another example: If someone asks you to write down 10 numbers (which they then dictate to you). You write down 5 of them, but cannot remember the other five so you write 5 of your own to make it up to 10 numbers. They come to check the numbers you have written down. Do they say &quot;yes, those are the numbers I gave you (they verify) or do they say &quot;no, you only have five of the numbers I gave you?&quot;</li></ul>
<p>The bottom line is this: if the physical scriptures were corrupted, Allah would not say he &quot;verifies that which you have&quot; he would have said that he &quot;verifies <i>parts</i> of which you have&quot; and then indicate that the texts are no longer intact. The only conclusions we can draw from these statements of Allah, are that: <br>
(a) The Jews were literate - they knew their scriptures; they 'threw the book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing.&quot; How could they know the book of Allah if it was corrupted?<br>
(b) That The Jews and Christians both had intact (alleged) revelations from Allah when the Qur'an was revealed. Since we have manuscripts that pre-date Muhammad's time, that are the same as the Bible we have today, then we can conclude that the scriptures that we have today are the same as they were in Muhammad's time.

<p>We have thus far, given a lot of examples where the Jews were mentioned specifically, or just 'people of the book'. Was Allah referring to the previous scriptures (and corruption) as being just the Taurat, or does he include the Injil?

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_3">Analysis</span></h3>
<p>Confirmed in the above Qur'an verses is the fact that Allah claims to have revealed both the Taurat (to Musa) and Injil (to Isa). Qur'an 5:47 confirms also that the Injil was intact during Muhammad's time, when it says &quot;and the followers of the Injeel should have judged by what Allah revealed in it&quot;. This shows, that, in order to judge Muhammad's truthfulness on his prophetic claim, the Christians should have gone to the Injil which they <i>had with them</i> in order to 'confirm' his claim. Allah is inferring that their scripture, as well as that of the Jews, is uncorrupted. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Qur.27an_2:79_in_Context">Qur'an 2:79 in Context</span></h2>
<p>Many apologists accuse critics of taking the Qur'an 'out of context' in order to make Islam look bad. However in the case of <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.079#002.079">2:79</a>, apologists <i>need</i> to take it out of context in order to 'prove' that the Qur'an says the 'previous scriptures' were physically corrupted. Here it is in context:
</p>
<div class="quotes">And there are among them illiterates who know not the Book but only lies, and they do but conjecture. Woe, then, to those who write the book with their hands and then say: This is from Allah, so that they may take for it a small price; therefore woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.078#002.078">2:78-79</a></div></div>
<p>So if we were to look at verse 2:79 which is given to us by some as evidence, then it would appear that the Qur'an does charge some (unknown) people with writing a book without knowledge and claiming it is a revelation from Allah. However if we look at the preceding verse, we note that it says that the people who do this are <i>illiterate</i>. This means that have not read Allah's previous revelations.

<p>The quotes from the verses above establish that the Jews and Christians were literate people who knew their scriptures. 
</p>
<ul><li>Jews are accused of knowing the book, but when Muhammad claimed to be a prophet of Allah, the Qur'an asserts that they 'threw the book' (Taurat) 'behind their back as if they knew nothing.'</li>
<li>Allah confirms that they Jews teach from the book and 'read it themselves'</li>
<li>The Christians are told that they should have consulted their books and 'confirmed' what Muhammad was saying before rejecting him. </li>
<li>Both Jews and Christians are told to judge between their respective books and the Qur'an to judge whether Muhammad was truthful. </li></ul>
<p>The only verse that slightly resembles Qur'an 2:78-79 is 3:79. However it charges that the Jews knew what their scriptures said, but corrupted it <i>with their tongues</i>.  How are the Jews and Christians supposed to know that the Qur'an verifies their books if they cannot read their own books? Why would Jews hide the book behind their backs if they did not know what it said? 
All the verses above show that the Qur'an never charges that the Jews and Christians are illiterate; quite the opposite, therefore Qur'an 2:79 <i>cannot</i> be referring to them 'writing the book with their hands.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Who_are_the_Illiterate_and_what_.27Book.27_did_they_write.3F">Who are the Illiterate and what 'Book' did they write?</span></h4>
<p>The Qur'an does not elaborate on exactly what scripture was being written by these 'illiterates', but looking at the evidence above, we know that it is not the people of the Book. There are three possible explanations for who these illiterate people manufacturing scripture were:
</p>
<ul><li>If the People of the Book truly were changing the scripture in their recitations of it to the illiterate people, it is not unreasonable to surmise that an illiterate person (who could not read the original documents) then wrote down (or elaborated on) what they heard in the recitation.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Allah was originally a pagan moon god; thus these verses could mean that pagans were writing scripture and claiming it was from Mr &quot;I have moon god daughters&quot; Allah.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Qur'an makes the &quot;Surah Like It&quot; Challenge:</li></ul>
<div class="quotes">And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call on your witnesses besides Allah if you are truthful.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.023#002.023">2:23</a></div></div>

<p>It is most likely that Qur'an 2:78-79 is referring to the people who took up this challenge to produce a surah like it. However, since the Qur'an does not elaborate, we can only say for certainty that it is <i>not</i> referring to the Jews and Christians.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>On review of the evidence, we have learned thus far:
</p>
<ol><li>The Qur'an never charges that the Jews and Christians have physically corrupted their scriptures. It states that they have 'changed words from their right places (with their mouths)' and 'concealed parts of the message given to them'.</li>
<li>The Qur'an claims to verify the books that they have with them. This precludes the possibility that the People of the Book had corrupted scriptures in their possession at the time of Muhammad.  The language used in the Qur'an confirms that the whole texts were intact and 'verified' by the Qur'an. Since we have Biblical texts that pre-date Islam, that match what we have today, we know that today's scriptures are the same as they were in and before Muhammad's time. </li>
<li>We know that Allah is 'verifying' both the Taurat and Injil; telling Christians and Jews to check their specific scriptures to 'judge by what Allah has revealed.'</li>
<li>Both the Jews and Christians were literate peoples who knew their scriptures. </li>
<li>Qur'an 2:79 when read in context clearly states that the <i>illiterate</i> people were writing the book 'with their own hands' and claiming it was from Allah. Since we know the people of the Book were literate, these verses are not referring to them. </li></ol>
<p>Consider the evidence: The Qur'an never says the physical scriptures of the previous revelations are corrupt (since we have precluded 2:79). If the previous scriptures are not corrupt, what do we do if the Qur'an contradicts the message of the Bible? Let's see what the Qur'an tells you to do:
</p>
<div class="quotes">But if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to you, <b>ask those who read the Book before you</b>; certainly the truth has come to you from your Lord, therefore you should not be of the disputers.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/010-qmt.php#010.094#010.094">10:94</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">And We did not send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation, <b>so ask the followers of the reminder</b> if you do not<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/021-qmt.php#021.007#021.007">21:7</a></div></div>
<p><b>Therefore Qur'an 2:79 is not referring to the previous scriptures</b>
