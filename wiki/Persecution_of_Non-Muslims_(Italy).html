<div class="quotes">A director of Italian public broadcaster RAI has urged the government to protect to one of its journalists after a suspected radical Muslim opened fire on his car in southern Italy. Nello Rega was uninjured in the attack as he drove home late on Thursday. Rega wrote a book on Islam’s uneasy relationship Christianity and has received several threats from alleged Muslim extremists over the past two years. “Last night’s attack should leave people in no doubt. Rega could have been killed. Why is he not adequately protected?” said Antonio Bagnardi, director of RAI Televideo, where Bagnardi works.
<p>“Isn’t it enough that he has beeen intimidated for months on end and now is a victim of attempted murder,” Bagnardi added, calling on Italy’s interior minister Roberto Maroni to intervene.
</p><p>A single shot was fired at Rega’s car from a vehicle that drew up alongside as he drove along a state highway near the city of Potenza in Italy’s Basilicata region, damaging Rega’s rear window. He reported the attack to police, who were examining his car as part of their investigation.
</p><p>Since his book ‘Different and Divided – a Diary of Coexistence with Islam’ Rega has received threats in the Italian capital, Rome, and in Potenza including an envelope mailed to him with bullets inside.

<div class="quotes">Drug trafficking, illegal immigration and Islamism: these were the three pillars of the vast network that is being dismantled by the Italian anti-terrorist police, after a lengthy investigation that began in April 2008. &quot;We drown Christians in drug,&quot; is what had been heard by investigators when wiretapping. 
<p>As part of Operation Scutum (shield), 40 search warrants were executed this morning against Pakistanis (mostly from the province of Peshawar) residing in Italy and accused of belonging to a organization for heroin trafficking, illegal immigration and forgery of documents. This, according to a note by the Prosecutor of Naples, who coordinated the operations of a &quot;criminal organization based on ethnicity,&quot; which was dedicated to drug trafficking from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Italy. It also provided huge quantities of drugs to another criminal organization composed entirely from members of the ethnic group of the Ghanaian &quot;Dagomba&quot;, which was based in the provinces of Naples and Caserta, with branches in Bologna and Varese, and which has also been dismantled by the police. 
</p><p>The wiretapping revealed a powerful Pakistani organization with branches throughout Italy, especially in the Naples area, Macerata, Bologna and Rome. Drugs, especially heroin originating from the Afghan province of Nangarhar ending up in Campania, and also in Bologna and Varese. The drug profits were used to support the Islamist movement &quot;Tehreek e Nafaz e Shariat e Mohammadi&quot; linked to the Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah, whose armed wing is active in the Swat Valley, Pakistan. 
</p><p>Investigators also uncovered regular contacts between Pakistani communities established in Italy and those of Spain and Britain to promote the entry of illegals from Pakistan. Seized in the searches were forms of regularization of 300 Pakistani workers, photocopies of passports, receipts for payments of 90,000 euros. 
</p>
A nice haul, then. Unfortunately, with tens of thousands of illegal and pseudo-refugees landing on Lampedusa in recent months, the networks of Muslim-ethnic criminals may be quickly replenished.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://fr.novopress.info/85145/italie-les-clandestins-voulaient-%C2%AB-noyer-les-chretiens-dans-la-drogue-%C2%BB/&date=2011-05-19?url=http://fr.novopress.info/85145/italie-les-clandestins-voulaient-%C2%AB-noyer-les-chretiens-dans-la-drogue-%C2%BB/&date=2011-05-19">Italy: illegal immigrants wanted to &quot;drown the Christians in drugs&quot;</a><br>NovoPress, May 19, 2011 (machine translated and edited slightly for readability)</div></div>

<div class="quotes">A murky wave of anti-Israel zeal is also growing at an alarming rate in Italy. “The old anti-Jewish libels are now aimed at the State of Israel”, says Stefano Gatti, one of the top researchers at the Center for Documentation in Milan.
<p>Pro-Palestinian activists are threatening to “ignite” Milan, the financial capital of Italy where an Israeli exhibit is going displayed in a central square. Meanwhile, the city of Turin hosted a “cultural festival” where the image of Shimon Peres was used as a shoe-throwing target. For one euro, Italian students had the chance to hit the face of Israel’s president, who was fitted with a Nazi-style Jewish nose. 
</p><p>An Israeli student at the University of Genoa has been harassed and threatened with death by Arab students. Muslim students shouted at him “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) and “Itbach el Yahud” (slaughter the Jews.) Another Israeli student at the University of Turin, Amit Peer, confessed that “the Jews here are hiding their own identity because they risk becoming a target.”<br>. . .<br>
Ucoii, the largest Islamic organization in Italy, published an ad in many mainstream newspapers entitled “Nazi Bloodshed Yesterday, Israeli Bloodshed Today.” An Italian court ruled that the Nazification of Israel came under “freedom of expression” and was not a case of incitement to hatred.<br>. . .<br>
The growing anti-Semitism is also evident by the security around the largest synagogue in Rome, one of the oldest in the world. The Jewish temple looks like a military outpost: Private guards everywhere, metal detectors and policemen at every corner. The Jewish school looks like a “sterilized area” protected by policemen, bodyguards and cameras. All school windows are plumbed with iron grates. I saw the same in the Jewish homes of Hebron and in the schools of Sderot.

Pro-Palestinian groups just recently marched into the ghetto, shouting “Fascist” and “Assassins” to the Jews, some of them Holocaust survivors. It was here, on 16 October 1943, that 1,200 Jews were deported to Auschwitz; none of the 200 Jewish children came back home. It was here, on 9 October 1982, that an Arab terrorist opened fire on Jews; a two-year old baby, Stefano Taché, became the first Italian victim of anti-Jewish violence since the war.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4081264,00.html&date=2011-06-14?url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4081264,00.html&date=2011-06-14">Italy against the Jews</a><br>Giulio Meotti, YNet News, June 13, 2011</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Around 35 people were injured Monday in southern Italy when people held in a migrant detention camp near the city of Bar staged a protest that turned into a riot.
<p>Some 100 migrants demonstrated to get their passports returned with visas to stay in Italy by blocking a rail line and state road. The protest turned violent when riot police were sent in to break up the demonstration and the migrants pelted them with stones.

</p><p>Twenty police and 15 migrants were injured in the incident.
</p><p>Separately, the bodies of 25 migrants were found Sunday in the hold of a vessel that set sail from Libya for the Italian island of Lampedusa.
</p>
More than 40,000 illegal immigrants have arrived on the island since popular uprisings broke out in North Africa early this year.

<div class="quotes">Recently, northern Italy has been rocked by earthquakes. Temporary camps have been set up to offer shelter to people in the affected area. Naturally, as happened in Spain last year, immigrants and wastrels, people who might have no fixed abode even in ordinary circumstances, descend on these camps to grab whatever they can get. There have been several complaints that the immigrants are receiving privileged admission to and treatment in the camps compared to native Italians. What's clear is that the Muslims, in particular, have an extraordinary sense of entitlement. 
<p>Last week Vodafone turned up to offer free phone cards. The Muslims started fighting over them. One pulled a knife and stabbed another Muslim. On Saturday, a riot broke out when a Muslim girl was served a pasta dish containing bolognese sauce. Apparently it was supposed to have been tuna but an innocent mistake had been made. She started screaming. Soon her family turned up and accused the camp administrators of deliberately insulting Islam! How they get to this conclusion from bolognese sauce I'm not sure about. I can only surmise that they were complaining about it because it is a meat sauce and the meat may not have been halal! A riot broke out and civil protection forces had to intervene to restore order.
</p><p>According to a local newspaper, &quot;the behaviour of the North Africans is getting on the nerves of many of the other disaster victims&quot;.

<div class="quotes">Two police were hospitalised with minor injuries in southern Italy following a revolt by more than a dozen Tunisian migrants who feared they would be sent home.
<p>The 14 migrants were arrested in the Italian southern region of Sicily after destroying the detention centre in the city of Ragusa where they were held. 
</p><p>The men, who had only arrived by boat to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa a couple of weeks before, were arrested by the police and accused of resistance and violence towards authorities in Ragusa, a city in southwestern Sicilian where the migrant centre was located.

<div class="quotes">It's another tough blow for the parish. The district of Libiola belongs to the city of Serravalle a Po. It was severely hit by the earthquake in May 2012 and the baroque church is still closed for repairs. You will recall that the quake that ravaged northeast Italy also led to an explosion of problems with the Muslim immigrants living close-by. A dish with bolognese sauce, served inadvertently to a young Muslim girl in a refugee camp, had set off a veritable riot. 
<p>In Libiola, life was getting back to normal. Last Thursday, the priest and the two nuns in charge of the youth club had taken the children for a day trip to the mountains. Four young Moroccans (one from the neighborhood, the others from near-by) took advantage and broke into the presbytery. They forced open the door of the sister superior's room and stole whatever money they could find, namely the children's dues and profits from a risotto dinner recently organized by the parents: 80 euros in all.
</p><p>The Maghrebins then, in the words of the Gazetta di Mantova, &quot;wanted to leave behind a sign&quot;. They cut through a panel of the plastic tent that has been serving as a provisional church since the earthquake. They urinated and defecated on the altar. A neighbor saw them flee and recognized the one who lives in the neighborhood. The carabinieri were able to identify the others. 
</p><p>The priest, Eugenio Ferrari, finally decided to lodge a complaint. &quot;If they had come to steal money because they were hungry,&quot; he explained, &quot;I never would have complained: I would have forgiven them. But what they did in the church is an act that cannot be ignored. It is unspeakable.&quot;
</p>
&quot;I am sorry,&quot; added the priest, &quot;because it appears that this was done by four young Moroccans. They showed their contempt for our religion. But if I did the same thing in a mosque, they would slit my throat, yes or no?&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><span class="citation web"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://fr.novopress.info/140632/italie-des-maghrebins-pillent-un-patronage-et-defequent-sur-lautel-de-leglise/">&quot;Italie : Des maghrébins pillent un patronage et défèquent sur l’autel de l’église&quot;</a> <span style="font-size:88%">(<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.novopress.info%2F140632%2Fitalie-des-maghrebins-pillent-un-patronage-et-defequent-sur-lautel-de-leglise%2F&date=2013-07-29?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.novopress.info%2F140632%2Fitalie-des-maghrebins-pillent-un-patronage-et-defequent-sur-lautel-de-leglise%2F&date=2013-07-29">archived</a>)</span><br> NOVOpress, July 25, 2013<span class="printonly">, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://fr.novopress.info/140632/italie-des-maghrebins-pillent-un-patronage-et-defequent-sur-lautel-de-leglise/">http://fr.novopress.info/140632/italie-des-maghrebins-pillent-un-patronage-et-defequent-sur-lautel-de-leglise/</a></span>.</span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=bookitem&rft.btitle=Italie+%3A+Des+maghr%C3%A9bins+pillent+un+patronage+et+d%C3%A9f%C3%A8quent+sur+l%E2%80%99autel+de+l%E2%80%99%C3%A9glise&rft.atitle=&rft.date=July+25%2C+2013&rft.pub=NOVOpress&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.novopress.info%2F140632%2Fitalie-des-maghrebins-pillent-un-patronage-et-defequent-sur-lautel-de-leglise%2F&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Persecution_of_Non-Muslims_(Italy)"><span style="display: none;"> </span></span></div></div>
