<div class="quotes">Allah then commanded fighting the disbelievers when He said:
<p><br>
(...until there is no more Fitnah) meaning, Shirk. This is the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi`, Muqatil bin Hayyan, As-Suddi and Zayd bin Aslam.
</p><p>Allah's statement:
</p><p><br>
(...and the religion (all and every kind of worship) is for Allah (Alone).) means, `So that the religion of Allah becomes dominant above all other religions.' It is reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari said: &quot;The Prophet was asked, `O Allah's Messenger! A man fights out of bravery, and another fights to show off, which of them fights in the cause of Allah' The Prophet said:
</p><p><br>
(He who fights so that Allah's Word is superior, then he fights in Allah's cause.) In addition, it is reported in the Two Sahihs:
</p>
(I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people until they proclaim, `None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. Whoever said it, then he will save his life and property from me, except for cases of the law, and their account will be with Allah.)<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=2&tid=5035?sid=2&tid=5035">The Order to fight until there is no more Fitnah</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>

<div class="quotes">(Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth among the People of the Scripture,) 
This honorable Ayah was revealed with the order to fight the People of the Book, after the pagans were defeated, the people entered Allah's religion in large numbers, and the Arabian Peninsula was secured under the Muslims' control. Allah commanded His Messenger to fight the People of the Scriptures, Jews and Christians, on the ninth year of Hijrah, and he prepared his army to fight the Romans and called the people to Jihad announcing his intent and destination. The Messenger sent his intent to various Arab areas around Al-Madinah to gather forces, and he collected an army of thirty thousand. Some people from Al-Madinah and some hypocrites, in and around it, lagged behind, for that year was a year of drought and intense heat. The Messenger of Allah marched, heading towards Ash-Sham to fight the Romans until he reached Tabuk, where he set camp for about twenty days next to its water resources. He then prayed to Allah for a decision and went back to Al-Madinah because it was a hard year and the people were weak, as we will mention, Allah willing.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.theholybook.org/content/view/7286/2/">The Order to fight People of the Scriptures until They give the Jizyah</a><br>Tafsir ibn Kathir</div></div>

<div class="quotes">
&quot;The theory that our religion is a peaceful and loving religion is a wrong theory...The Holy war as it is known in Islam is basically an offensive war, and it is the duty of all Muslims of every age, when the needed military power is available, because our prophet Muhammad said that he is ordered by Allah to fight all people until they say ‘No God but Allah,’ and he is his messenger...It is meaningless to talk about the holy war as only defensive, otherwise, what did the prophet mean when he said, &quot;from now on even if they don’t invade you, you must invade them.&quot;&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Dr. M.

<div class="quotes">&quot;Jihad Against the Kuffar is of two Types:  Offensive Jihad (where the enemy is attacked in his own territory) ... [and] Defensive Jihad. This is expelling the Kuffar from our land, and it is Fard Ayn [personal religious obligation on Muslim individuals], a compulsory duty upon all ...
...Where the Kuffar [infidels] are not gathering to fight the Muslims, the fighting becomes Fard Kifaya [religious obligation on Muslim society]  with the minimum requirement of appointing believers to guard borders, and the sending of an army at least once a year to terrorise the enemies of Allah. It is a duty of the Imam (Caliph) to assemble and send out an army unit into the land of war once or twice every year. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the Muslim population to assist him, and if he does not send an army he is in sin.- And the Ulama have mentioned that this type of jihad is for maintaining the payment of <a href="wiki/Jizyah.html" title="Jizyah">Jizya</a>. The scholars of the principles of religion have also said: &quot; Jihad is Daw'ah [Islamic preaching] with a force, and is obligatory to perform with all available capabilities, until there remains only Muslims or people who submit to Islam.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Misconceptions_about_Jihad.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamicemirate.com/fiqh-jurisprudence/jihad/1544-offensive-jihad-vs-defensive-jihad.html%20IslamicEmirate.com">Offensive Jihad Vs.

<div class="quotes">The penalties that the <i>Sharia</i> has introduced for those who disobey God and his Messengers of two kinds: the punishment of those who are under the sway [of an imam], both individuals and collectivities, as has been mentioned before [in the chapter on criminal law], and, secondly, the punishment of recalcitrant groups, such as those that can only be brought under the sway of the Imam by a decisive fight. That then is the jihad against the unbelievers (kuffar), the enemies of God and His Messenger. For whoever has heard the summons of the Messenger of God, Peace be upon him, and has not responded to it must be fought, &quot;<i>until there is no Fitna and the religion of God's entirely</i>&quot; (K. 2:193, 8:39).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Misconceptions_about_Jihad.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Taymiyyah, ‘Governance According to Allaah’s Law in Reforming

<p>Ahmad Sirhindi (d. 1624) was an Islamic scholar and a prominent Sufi. He is regarded as having rejuvenated Islam, due to which he is commonly called &quot;Mujadid Alf Thani&quot;, meaning &quot;reviver of the second millennium&quot;.
</p>
<div class="quotes"><i>Shariat can be fostered through the sword.<br><br></i>
<p><i>Kufr</i> and Islam are opposed to each other. The progress of one is possible only at the expense of the other and co-existences between these two contradictory faiths in unthinkable.<br><br>
The honor of Islam lies in insulting <i>kufr</i> and <i>kafirs</i>. One who respects <i>kafirs</i>, dishonors the Muslims. To respect them does not merely mean honouring them and assigning them a seat of honor in any assembly, but it also implies keeping company with them or showing considerations to them. They should be kept at an arm's length like dogs. ... If some worldly business cannot be performed without them, in that case only a minimum of contact should be established with them but without taking them into confidence. The highest Islamic sentiment asserts that it is better to forego that worldly business and that no relationship should be established with the <i>kafirs</i>.<br><br>
The real purpose in levying <i>jizya</i> on them is to humiliate them to such an extent that, on account of fear of <i>jizya</i>, they may not be able to dress well and to live in grandeur. They should constantly remain terrified and trembling. It is intended to hold them under contempt and to uphold the honor and might of Islam.<br>. . .<br>

<p>Killing Muslim civilians (theory of tattarus) via the use of them as human shields.
</p>
<div class="quotes">The debate has been triggered by the killing of large numbers of Muslims, including women and children, by Islamist insurgents in Iraq. Are such acts permissible? Judging by fatwas (religious opinions) and articles by Muslim theologians and commentators, the Islamic ummah (community) is divided on the issue. 
<p>Those who believe that killing innocent people, including Muslims, is justified in certain cases, base their opinion on the principle of tattarrus. The word, which originally meant &quot;dressing up,&quot; was first used as a religious term in the book &quot;Al-Mustasfa&quot; (&quot;The Place of Purification&quot;) by Abu-Hamed al-Ghazali (d.1127), to mean &quot;using ordinary Muslims as human shields for Islamic combatants against infidel fighters.&quot;<br>. . .<br>
Initially, al-Qaradawi had ruled that only three categories of unarmed individuals could be killed: apostates, who have turned their back to Islam; homosexuals, who &quot;dirty&quot; the pure society — and Israelis, including unborn children, who could grow up to join the Jewish army. 
</p><p>Now, however, al-Qaradawi has expanded his doctrine to <b>allow for the killing of innocent Muslims in Iraq</b>. His argument is stark: What matters is the broader interest of the Islamic ummah which could, under certain circumstances, necessitate operations in which Muslim civilians lose their lives.
</p><p><br>
<b>That position is supported by several Saudi theologians</b>, including Hammoud al-Uqalla, Ali al-Khudhair, Nasser al-Fahd, Ahmad al-Khalidi and Safar al-Hawali. Their argument is that the broader interest of the ummah requires the expulsion of the U.S.-led forces from Iraq and that the killing of innocent Iraqis in whatever numbers is of no concern to the combatants, whose place in paradise is assured. 
</p>
<b>Other Saudi theologians, including Abu-Muhammad al-Maqdasi and Abu-Basir al-Tartussi, go further and apply tattarrus to situations where no &quot;infidel&quot; troops are present.</b> Thus they justify the killing of innocent Muslim Saudis in Saudi Arabia because, they claim, such actions could lead to the establishment of a &quot;truly Islamic regime.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Misconceptions_about_Jihad.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><br> </div>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/Shahid.html" title="Shahid">Shahid</a></div>
<p>While some are against it, many scholars such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi and Zakir Naik claim suicide bombing is permitted in Islam. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtZxNqxpb8s?v=JtZxNqxpb8s">Click here</a> to watch an explanation by Zakir Naik in one of his lectures. 
</p><p>Below is a fatwa issued by Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, discussing the reasons why it is permissible for women to participate in &quot;Martyr Operations&quot; (e.g. suicide bombings).
</p>
<div class="quotes">Women’s participation in the martyr operations carried out in Palestine – given the status of the land as an occupied territory, in addition to a lot of sacrilegious acts perpetrated by the Jews against the sanctuaries – is one of the most praised acts of worship. Also, the act is a form of martyrdom in the Cause of Allah, and it entitles them, Insha’ Allah, to the same reward earned by their male counterparts who also die in the Cause of Allah.<br>. . .<br>
<p>The martyr operations is the greatest of all sorts of Jihad in the Cause of Allah. A martyr operation is carried out by a person who sacrifices himself, deeming his life less value than striving in the Cause of Allah, in the cause of restoring the land and preserving the dignity. To such a valorous attitude applies the following Qur’anic verse: “And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah; and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen.” (Al-Baqarah: 207)
</p><p>But a clear distinction has to be made here between martyrdom and suicide. Suicide is an act or instance of killing oneself intentionally out of despair, and finding no outlet except putting an end to one’s life. On the other hand, martyrdom is a heroic act of choosing to suffer death in the Cause of Allah, and that’s why it’s considered by most Muslim scholars as one of the greatest forms of Jihad.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
In the same vein, the public welfare should be given priority to the personal one, in the sense that if there is a contradiction between the private right and the public one, the latter must be given first priority for it concerns the interest of the whole Ummah. Given all this, I believe a woman can participate in this form of Jihad according to her own means and condition. Also, the organizers of these martyr operations can benefit from some believing women as they may do, in some cases, what is impossible for men to do.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545134?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545134">Palestinian Women Carrying Out Martyr Operations</a><br>Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, IslamOnline, November 6, 2006</div></div>
<p>Below is an excerpt taken from a fatwa by Muslim scholar Sheikh al-Uyayri, explaining in depth why suicide bombings and killing of civilians (including Muslims) via the use of them as &quot;human shields&quot; is permissible in Islam. Due to space (the fatwa is fifteen pages in length) we cannot quote it here in its entirety, but we strongly urge you to take your time and read it. Referencing the Qur'an and hadith, this piece is enlightening.
</p>
<div class="quotes">We have arrived at the conclusion that martyrdom operations are permissible, and in fact <b>the Mujahid who is killed in them is better than one who is killed fighting in the ranks</b>, for there are gradations even among martyrs, corresponding to their role, action effort and risk undertaken. Then, we explained how martyrdom operations are the least costly to the Mujahideen and most detrimental to the enemy. We have heard, as you must have, that <b>most scholars today permit such operations; at least 30 Fatawa have been issued to this effect</b>. We explained how this issue is derived from the issue of plunging single-handedly into the enemy ranks; something which is praiseworthy by the agreement of jurists. We then further stated that we preferred the view that such an action is permissible even if martyrdom is the only goal, although it is certainly not the optimal practice. Martyrdom operations should not be carried out unless certain conditions are met:
<p>1. One's intention is sincere and pure - to raise the Word of Allah. <br>
2. One is reasonably sure that the desired effect cannot be achieved by any other means which would guarantee preservation of his life. <br>
3. One is reasonably sure that loss will be inflicted on the enemy, or they will be frightened, or the Muslims will be emboldened. <br>
4. One should consult with war strategy experts, and especially with the amber of war, for otherwise he may upset plan and alert the enemy to their presence.
</p><p>If the first condition is absent, the deed is worthless, but if it is satisfied while some others are lacking, then it is not the best thing, but this does not necessarily mean the Mujahid is not shaheed.
</p>
<b>We also explained how causing a death carries the same verdict as actual killing. Hence one who plunges without armour into the enemy ranks, being certain of death, just like one who engages in a martyrdom operation, is effectively causing his own death, but they are praiseworthy because of the circumstances and intention, and hence are not considered to have committed suicide.</b> We also clarified that [according to the majority] the identity of the killer does not have an effect on whether the Mujahid will be considered shaheed. This dispels the wavering arising from the fact that the Mujahid is taking his own life. Thus, such operations could take on any of the five Shar`i verdicts depending on intention and circumstances. Finally, we clarified that taking one's own life is not always blameworthy; rather it is contingent on the motives behind it. So, we conclude that one who kills himself because of his strong faith and out of love for Allah and the Prophet, and in the interests of the religion, is praiseworthy.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_Islamic_Ruling_on_the_Permissibility_of_Martyrdom_Operations.html" title="The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations">The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations</a><br>Sheikh al-Uyayri</div></div>

<div class="quotes">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) Linah is an especially good type of date tree. Abu `Ubaydah said that Linah is a different kind of dates than `Ajwah and Barni. Several others said that Linah refers to every type of date fruits, except for the `Ajwah (ripen dates), while Ibn Jarir said that it refers to all kinds of date trees. Ibn Jarir quoted Mujahid saying that it also includes the Buwayrah type. When the Messenger of Allah laid siege to Bani An-Nadir, to <b>humiliate them and bring fear and terror to their hearts</b>, he ordered their date trees to be cut down. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Yazid bin Ruman, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &quot;<b>Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Messenger , saying that he used to outlaw mischief in the earth</b>, so why did he order that their trees be cut down Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever Linah was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them.<i> Mujahid said, &quot;Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur'an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah's leave.</i> There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning.

<p><b>Recent fatwas'</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">There are two situations where women could participate in Jihad.
<p>First, if the enemies invade Muslims in their homes, all Muslims who could carry weapons (women, men, and children) must participate in fighting to chase away the enemies and protect Muslim territorial integrity. In this situation, they should participate in any way they can.
Second, if the Muslims invade their enemies, in this case, the Muslim women can participate and go with the Muslim army if the latter is a strong and powerful army and if there is no fear that Muslim women would be taken prisoners. Ibn Abdel Bar [who was a famous Maliki Islamic Scholar] said: 'They (the women) can go with the army if the army is strong enough to take hold of the enemy's army'.
This is the opinion of all scholars and it is an imitation of a Sunnah that the Prophet did and his companions followed. In fact the Prophet took his wives and some of the wives of the Muslims in several Ghazawa (holy battles in the company of the Prophet) as narrated in a sound Hadith. 
But the role of women was limited mostly in looking after the wounded and providing food and drink to the men. However, whenever they are requested to carry weapons or fight they should do so, especially now when women can participate in war without having to travel. If she has to travel it should be within the limits of her nature.
Um Umara Nasiba Bint Kaab Al Ansaria fought in Uhud and also fought with the army that killed Musailimah, the liar. She was wounded in thirteen places that day and her hand was cut off.
</p>
Originally war was a male affair. But women can participate in it if there is dire need for it and provided that they would not be made prisoners.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=82641?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=82641">Women fighting in Jihad</a><br>Islam Web, Fatwa No. 82641, February 27, 2001</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Dear questioner, Muslim jurists unanimously agreed that, when the enemy attacks part of the Muslim territories Jihad become an Individual Duty on every one. This obligation reaches a certain extent that a woman should go out for Jihad even without the permission of her husband, and the son without the consent of his parents.<br>. . .<br>
<p>When Jihad becomes an Individual Duty, as when the enemy seizes the Muslim territory, a woman becomes entitled to take part in it alongside men. Jurists maintained that: When the enemy assaults a given Muslim territory, it becomes incumbent upon all its residents to fight against them to the extent that a woman should go out even without the consent of her husband, a son can go too without the permission of his parent, a slave without the approval of his master, and the employee without the leave of his employer. This is a case where obedience should not be given to anyone in something that involves disobedience to Allah, according to a famous juristic rule.<br>. . .<br>
As for the point that carrying out this operation may involve woman’s travel from place to another without a Mahram, we say that a woman can travel to perform Hajj in the company of other trustworthy women and without the presence of any Mahram as long as the road is safe and secured. Travel, nowadays, is no longer done through deserts or wilderness, instead, women can travel safely in trains or by air.
</p>
Concerning the point on Hijab, a woman can put on a hat or anything else to cover her hair. Even when necessary, she may take off her Hijab in order to carry out the operation, for she is going to die in the Cause of Allah and not to show off her beauty or uncover her hair. I don’t see any problem in her taking off Hijab in this case.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545134?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503545134">Palestinian Women Carrying Out Martyr Operations</a><br>Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Islam Online, November 6, 2006</div></div>
