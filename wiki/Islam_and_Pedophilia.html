<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h2>
<p><b>Pedophilia</b> <sup>(US)</sup> or <i>paedophilia</i> <sup>(UK)</sup> is the paraphilia of being sexually attracted to prepubescent or peripubescent children.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> A person with this attraction is called a <i>pedophile</i> or <i>paedophile</i>.
</p><p>Some pedophiles are sexually attracted to children only (exclusive pedophiles) whilst others are sexually attracted to both children and adults.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mayo_Clinic_3-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-Mayo_Clinic-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>In contrast to the generally accepted medical definition, the term <i>pedophile</i> is also used colloquially to denote significantly older adults who are sexually attracted to adolescents below the local age of consent,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> as well as those who have sexually abused a child.
</p><p>In contemporary law enforcement definitions, the term &quot;pedophile&quot; is generally used to describe those accused or convicted of the sexual abuse of a minor. Pedophilia is considered a taboo and is illegal in most societies, cultures and religions; except in the Islamic world with regards to <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>.

<div class="quotes"><b>A.</b> Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger).
<p><b>B.</b> The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies caused marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.

<p>Besides Muhammad himself, his companions also committed pedophilia. Umar was the 2<sup>nd</sup> caliph of Islam and married Umm Kulthum at a time when she was 10-12 years old. Some sources even say that she was five years old when Umar married her.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
&quot;'Umar asked 'Ali for the hand of his daughter, Umm Kulthum in marriage. 'Ali replied that <b>she has not yet attained the age (of maturity)</b>. 'Umar replied, 'By Allah, this is not true. You do not want her to marry me. If she is underage, send her to me'. Thus 'Ali gave his daughter Umm Kulthum a dress and asked her to go to 'Umar and tell him that her father wants to know what this dress is for. When she came to Umar and gave him the message, he grabbed her hand and forcibly pulled her towards him. 'Umm Kulthum asked him to leave her hand, which Umar did and said, 'You are a very mannered lady with great morals. Go and tell your father that you are very pretty and you are not what he said of you'.

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/Aishas_Age_of_Consummation.html" title="Aishas Age of Consummation">Aisha's Age of Consummation</a></div>
<p>Some Muslim apologists have recently claimed that Aisha was actually older than nine lunar years at time of the consummation of her marriage to Prophet Muhammad. They have attempted to explain that Aisha was in fact not nine-years-old as the Sahih hadiths of her own testimony claim, but some other ages derived from misquotations, indirect sources, fuzzy dating techniques and slander. These dubious research techniques have led to several conflicting ages to be proposed for Aisha at the time of consummation, including 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 21 years. 
</p><p>This article analyzes every single argument put forward by these apologists, and provides additional information on the origins and history of the &quot;Aisha was older&quot; apologetic arguments, and the only logical purpose behind making them.
</p><p>On closer inspection of these polemics you will discover that the various claims can be broadly categorized into these categories; unjustified slanders against Hisham ibn Urwah and the Iraqi narrators, the use of non-sahih information to refute otherwise sahih hadiths, the use of secondary and indirect sources in preference of direct testimonies, the use of ‘imprecise’ dating in preference to specific dates and statements of age, the use of misquoted references and erroneous information, the use of incorrect logic, and personal opinion.
</p><p>Aisha was nine lunar years old at the time her marriage to the Islamic prophet was consummated and there is simply no valid evidence that suggests otherwise. The majority of Muslims today, including both scholars and the general Muslim population, agree. This has been the mainstream Muslim understanding throughout Islam's 1,400 year history, and many of these honest Muslims take offense to these lies propagated by Muslim apologists who are embarrassed by their own prophet's actions.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Meaning_of_.27Consummate.27">The Meaning of 'Consummate'</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/The_Meaning_of_Consummate.html" title="The Meaning of Consummate">The Meaning of Consummate</a></div>
<p>Some Muslim apologist refuse to accept the existence of narrations given by Aisha in which she states that she was married to Prophet Muhammad when she was six years old and that he consummated his marriage with her when she was nine lunar years of age, even though these are recorded in Bukhari's sahih ahadith collection.
</p><p>These apologists will usually resort to questioning the English translation of Dr. Mushin Khan, without addressing the ahadith in their original Arabic. A reading of the relevant Bukhari ahadith make it clear that Muhammad had sexual intercourse with Aisha when she was nine years of age. 
</p><p>The terms used are: &quot;udkhilath&quot; and &quot;bana biha&quot;, which can only mean &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; in the context of the ahadith. The confusion from Muslims regarding this comes from their lack of understanding regarding the English phrase &quot;consummation of marriage&quot;, their ignorance of Arabic and their unwillingness to admit that their prophet had sexual intercourse with a nine year old child.

<p>This article refutes the claim that Joseph, the husband of Mary (the mother of Jesus Christ), was a pedophile, a popular yet erroneous tu quoque argument used to defend Prophet Muhammad's pedophilic marriage to Aisha.
</p><p>Upon reading the non-canonical apocrypha, the Christian equivalent of da`if (weak) or maudu (fabricated) hadith, we find it does not say Mary married Joseph when she was aged only 12. It in fact says she was possibly 17 years of age at the time the marriage was eventually consummated, if ever (Mary's perpetual virginity, the belief that Mary remained a virgin her entire life, is an essential article of faith for the majority of the world's Christians).
</p><p>The most decisive argument against the claim that Joseph was a pedophile is the fact that the same non-canonical writings which are used to gather information on Joseph and Mary's age, also confirm Mary's status as &quot;ever virgin&quot; (in The History of Joseph the Carpenter, Jesus says on Joseph's death &quot;my mother, virgin undefiled&quot;).

<p>This article refutes miscellaneous apologetics which may not be fully covered in our other articles, but are used by some to justify the marriage between the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and his six-year-old bride Aisha.
</p><p>The 26 different excuses covered include; Muhammad can't be a pedophile because he also had sex with grown women, pedophiles prefer children but Muhammad had many adult wives and only one child-bride, at that time it was okay to have sex with 9 year-olds in Arabia, people lived shorter life spans back then, and menstruation in hot climates starts earlier than in cold ones, so girls in Arabia matured as early as nine.

<p>Due to its many endorsements within Islamic scripture, child marriages are permitted by the majority of Muslim scholars and leaders, and in many Islamic countries it is common practice. 
Girls far below the age of puberty are forcibly married to older persons  (sometimes in their 50s and later) for various personal gains by the girls' guardian or with the intention to preserve family honor by helping her avoid pre-marital sex. 
</p><p>Pedophilic Islamic marriages are most prevalent in Pakistan and Afghanistan, followed by other countries in the <a href="wiki/Middle_East.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and Bangladesh.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> This practice may also be prevalent to a lesser extent amongst other Muslim communities, and is on the rise among the growing Muslim populations in many non-Muslim countries, such as the United Kingdom<sup id="cite_ref-Ten-fold_rise_in_forced_marriages_in_just_four_years_7-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-Ten-fold_rise_in_forced_marriages_in_just_four_years-7">[7]</a></sup> and the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> 
</p><p>In countries like Yemen, Bangladesh, Iran, and Northern Nigeria, attempts at reforming laws and banning child marriages have been opposed and stopped on the grounds that such a ban would be un-Islamic,<sup id="cite_ref-TONOV282008_9-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-TONOV282008-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-TNTJuly212013_10-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-TNTJuly212013-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weekly_Blitz_11-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-Weekly_Blitz-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MESSAGE_12-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-MESSAGE-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IRIN_13-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-IRIN-13">[13]</a></sup> and in the case of Malaysia, the growing Muslim population has effectively turned back the clock on social progress by passing new laws which allow for the practice of pedophilic marriages specifically between followers of Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-World_News_Australia_14-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-World_News_Australia-14">[14]</a></sup> 
</p><p>So one has to agree that whatever reasons and justification people may give for the prevalence of child marriages in Muslim-majority nations, without Islam this practice would have long been discarded as immoral and unacceptable in the modern world.

<p>This hub page contains English translations of various Arabic/Islamic media discussing pedophilia.

<div class="quotes">The Noble Qur'an has also mentioned the waiting period [i.e. for a divorced wife to remarry] for the wife who has not yet menstruated, saying: &quot;And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women - if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated&quot; [Qur'an 65:4]. Since this is not negated later, we can take from this verse that it is permissible to have sexual intercourse with a prepubescent girl. The Qur'an is not like the books of jurisprudence which mention what the implications of things are, even if they are prohibited. It is true that the prophet (PBUH) entered into a marriage contract with 'A'isha when she was six years old, however he did not have sex with her until she was nine years old, according to al-Bukhari.
Therefore the issue is fixed in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. There is no jurisprudence without it being accused of being a 'male jurisprudence'!!! For a portion of the women in our day deny the jurisprudential efforts of scholars with the accusation that their masculinity leads them to jurisprudence which is in their best-interest, and against women. It appears that those who are led by this idea have the image stuck in their minds of a father or shaykh of a mosque, who would resort to religion. As this was his (description), it was not desirable. But this is not how it was, according to what was related by Allah Almighty: &quot;But if the right is on their side, they come to him with all submission&quot; [Qur'an 24:49]. Wherefore the history of jurisprudence is abounding [with examples] which dispel this mania, and this is not the place to lay them all out. But what can those who follow the Western feminist agenda say to this Qur'anic text, and to the marriage of the Prophet to 'A'isha (may Allah be pleased with her)!!!<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.islamonline.net/ar/IOLCounsel_C/1278406761316/1278406720653/%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%9F-&date=2011-02-03?url=http://www.islamonline.net/ar/IOLCounsel_C/1278406761316/1278406720653/%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B2-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%9F-&date=2011-02-03">Is it permissible to restrict the age at which girls can marry?</a><br>Submitted by Ahmad, IslamOnline, December 24, 2010</div></div>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Aisha.html" title="The Tragedy of Aisha">The Tragedy of Aisha</a></div>
<p>It is no secret that sexual abuse of children has serious consequences on its victims and, among Muslims and non-Muslims alike, it is no longer a secret that the Qur'an explicitly condones pedophilia. Of course, for Muslims to finally acknowledge the harmful effects of abuse on a child it becomes necessary for us to expose those effects through authentic Islamic sources. That is why we find Aisha, Muhammad's third and &quot;favorite&quot; wife, to be the perfect model for assessing pedophilia and its consequences on the victims. The life of Aisha bint Abu Bakr truly was a seventh century tragedy.

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/Was_Muhammad_a_Pedophile.html" title="Was Muhammad a Pedophile?">Was Muhammad a Pedophile?</a></div>
<p>A second look at the question; was Muhammad a pedophile? One of the most disturbing things about Islam is that it does not categorically condemn pedophilia. Indeed, it cannot, for to do so would draw attention to the pedophilia of Muhammad, the founder of Islam. Many Muslims cannot condemn pedophilia even if they would like to, for they would have to abandon Islam. Muslims tacitly approve of pedophilia, even if they are embarrassed to say so. So mesmerized are Muslims by the example of Muhammad's pedophilia that they are unable to categorically denounce pedophilia or feel shame. It is prevalent in many Muslim countries disguised as child marriage. The UN is today trying to stop the evil of child marriage among the backward Islamic regions of Asia and Africa. The future of some 300 million young girls depends on it.

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/Aisha_and_Puberty.html" title="Aisha and Puberty">Aisha and Puberty</a></div>
<p>The doll-playing exegesis used in &quot;Aisha's Age of Consummation&quot; in itself proves Aisha's status as pre-pubescent at the time of the consummation of her marriage to Muhammad, but most Muslims are unaware that the Sahih ahadith say that Aisha, was below the age of puberty when she was at least fourteen years old, and remained in that state till the age of sixteen. This is because they have never read the Sahih ahadith in Arabic. 
</p><p>The narrators of the Sahih ahadith were not ashamed that Muhammad had married and had sexual relations with Aisha when she was below the age of puberty. Hence, from the original Arabic, it is clear that Aisha was below the age of puberty at the age of 14 (at the time of the raid on the Bani Mustaliq) or 15 (at the time of the Ethiopian slaves dancing incident), and begun her first menstrual period at the age of 16 (during the journey for hajj).

<p>This page consists of quotes relating to Muhammad's pedophilia made by notable individuals. For example, Simon Ockley, who was chosen Adams Professor of Arabic at Cambridge University:
</p>
<div class="quotes">An Arabian author cited by Maracci,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> says that Abubeker was very averse to the giving him his daughter [Ayesha, who was then but seven years old] so young, but that Mohammed pretended a divine command for it; whereupon he sent her to him with a basket of dates, and when the girl was alone with him, he stretched out his blessed hand (these are the author’s words), and rudely took hold of her clothes; upon which she looked fiercely at him, and said, “People call you the faithful man,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> but your behaviour to me shows you are a perfidious one.” And with these words she got out of his hands, and, composing her clothes, went and complained to her father. The old gentleman, to calm her resentment, told her she was new betrothed to Mohammed, and that made him take liberties with her, as if she had been his wife.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><br> </div>
