<p>To hear groups like the Council of American-Islamic Relations or the Islamic Society of North America, one might be given the impression that Islam holds women in high regard. Indeed, Souad Saleh, a female professor at Al-Ahzar University in Cairo and a vocal proponent of women's rights in Egypt, recently stated, &quot;Islam is pure and simple, and it holds women in high esteem.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Women.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> If women are treated equally in Islam, is there justification for it in the sacred writings of Islam, or is this 'equal treatment' in conflict with sacred directives? What does the Qur'an say about women? What does Muhammad say about women as recorded in the hadith, and what kind of example did he set in the way he treated the women in his life? Do the reports we hear of women being oppressed accord with sacred scripture, or are they rather anomalies having no foundation in Islam? What have women from an Islamic background actually experienced – what are their stories? These are some of the issues this article addresses.

<p>Muhammad's dislike for women caused him to declare that the <i>majority of the inhabitants of Hell are women</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Women.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> When asked why he said it was because they are deficient in intelligence and religion and because they are ungrateful to their husbands. Although Muslim apologists and female Muslims use a lot of creative arguments to explain away Muhammad's declarations about women, they don't stand up to scrutiny. This article will present evidence showing Muhammad's belief that <i>all</i> women are less intelligent than their male counterparts, as well as examine and refute the common Muslim claims about the ahadith in question.

<div class="quotes">
<p>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:
</p>
Once Allah's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o 'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, &quot;O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women).&quot; They asked, &quot;Why is it so, O Allah's Apostle ?&quot; He replied, &quot;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. <b>I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you.</b> A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.&quot; The women asked, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?&quot; He said, <b>&quot;Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?&quot;</b> They replied in the affirmative. <b>He said, &quot;This is the deficiency in her intelligence.</b> Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?&quot; The women replied in the affirmative. He said, &quot;This is the deficiency in her religion.&quot; <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/006-sbt.php#001.006.301#001.006.301">1:6:301</a></div></div>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Articles: <a href="wiki/Revelation_of_the_Hijab.html" title="Revelation of the Hijab">Revelation of the Hijab</a> and <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Hijab.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Hijab">Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Hijab</a></div>
<p>If you ask a Muslim why Muslim females wears the Hijab (veil) the reason given is usually one of two (or a mixture of both):
</p>
<ul><li> They are showing obeying a command from Allah as given in the Quran; it is a matter of piety.</li>
<li> They are protecting their modesty by dressing this way instead of showing their body off for everyone to see. </li></ul>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. The real reason that Muslim women wear the hijab today is not a spiritual one, nor a matter of piety. Covering the hair/face cannot be considered an act of modesty because Muslim men are not required to cover theirs. The sole reason they do it is because Umar bin Al-Khattab, a companion of Muhammad, wished that Muhammad would reveal verses from Allah requiring women to wear it. when Muhammad did not oblige, Umar did not bother praying to Allah for assistance. Umar knew he had to make it personal for Muhammad himself in order to bring the revelation down. He followed Muhammad's wives out when they went to go to the toilet and made his presence known.  When Muhammad heard of this, the revelation that Umar had so wanted was sent down from Allah. Umar knew where these revelations were really coming from, which is why he pestered Muhammad and bothered his wives instead of asking Allah.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Purpose_of_the_Nikah_Contract_.28Islamic_.22Marriage.22.29">The Purpose of the Nikah Contract (Islamic &quot;Marriage&quot;)</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Article: <a href="wiki/The_Meaning_of_Nikah.html" title="The Meaning of Nikah">The Meaning of Nikah</a></div>
<p>The correct Arabic word for &quot;marriage&quot;, used primarily by non-Muslim Arabs, is &quot;zawaj&quot;. In Islam, the nearest equivalent to a marriage is the nikah, a contract between a male and a female Muslim. Nikah literally means &quot;sexual intercourse&quot;, hence an Islamic marriage is a &quot;contract of coitus&quot;.   
</p>
<div class="quotes">When a woman marries, she sells a part of her person. In the market one buys merchandise, <b>in marriage the husband buys the genital <i>arvum mulieris</i></b>. As in any other bargain and sale, only useful and ritually clean objects may be given in dower.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ruxton (1916: 106). Quoted by Ziba Mir-Hosseini in volume five of Voices of Islam, pp. 85-113</div></div>
<div class="quotes">The Arabic word for marriage is zawaj or <b>nikah, the latter being derived from the verb nakaha (‘to have sexual intercourse’): cf. Qur. II: 230</b>. Nikah is also used to denote the marriage contract (cf. ‘aqd, ‘aqd qiran).<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ronak Husni, Daniel L. Newman, Muslim women in law and society: annotated translation of al-Tahir al Haddad al-Ṭāhir Ḥaddād, p. 182</div></div>
<div class="quotes">[These are eight things. The first, marriage, is the root and rest are consequences. Each has a linguistic meaning and usage which we will mention in its proper place. Marriage <b>(nikah) linguistically means intercourse</b> and is used as a metaphor for the contract. In technical usage, it is actual for the contract and metaphorical for intercourse. It is used in custom to mean to mean intercourse as the Almighty says, &quot;Until she marries a husband other than him,&quot; <b>(2:230) and so it is known from this that nakaha is used for intercourse between any man and woman. Marriage in the sense of intercourse</b> is only permitted in the Shari'a by one of two matters: the contract of marriage or ownership by the words of the Almighty, &quot;those who guard their private parts – except from their wives or those they own as slaves, in which case they are not blameworthy.&quot; (23:5-6)<br> <div class="quotes_ref">The Risala of 'Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani (310/922 - 386/996) A Treatise on Maliki Fiqh (Inc. commentary from ath-Thamr ad-Dani by al-Azhari) Ch. 32</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Purpose_of_the_Mahr_.28Dowry.29">The Purpose of the Mahr (Dowry)</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Articles: <a href="wiki/Purpose_of_the_Mahr.html" title="Purpose of the Mahr">Purpose of the Mahr</a> and <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Mahr.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Mahr">Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Mahr</a></div>
<p>The apologetic claim made for provision of a mahr is that it is a token of goodwill given by the husband to the wife as a demonstration that he will be able to support her financially throughout the nikah (Islamic marriage). However the Qur'an and ahadith make it clear that this is not its true purpose.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying to the invokers of curse: Your account is with Allah. One of you must be a liar. You have now no right over this woman. '<b>He said: Messenger of Allah, what about my wealth (dower that I paid her at the time of marriage)? He said: You have no claim to wealth. If you tell the truth, it (dower) is the recompense for your having had the right to intercourse with her'</b>, and if you tell a lie against her, it is still more remote from you than she is. Zuhair said in his narration: Sufyan reported to us on the authority of 'Amr that he had heard Sa'id b Jubair saying: I heard Ibn Umar (Allah be pleased with them) saying that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said it. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/009-smt.php#009.3557#009.3557">9:3557</a> </div></div>
<p>The purpose of the mahr as explained by the Islamic texts is clear - it is a payment from a man to a women; payment in full for the future sexual relations (nikah) he will have with her. This is illustrated by the requirement for a mahr in temporary &quot;marriages&quot;, the statements of Muhammad, and the fact that a mahr cannot be taken back (except under extenuating circumstances) because the man has availed himself of the service for which it was payment. The apologetic claim that it is simply a demonstrative token of his ability to financially support his wife does not hold up to scrutiny once all of the evidence is examined. Even the Qur'an alone makes it clear this is incorrect.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rape_of_Women_in_Islam">Rape of Women in Islam</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main Articles: <a href="wiki/Rape_in_Islam.html" title="Rape in Islam">Rape in Islam</a> and <a href="wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars-Rape.html" title="Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Rape">Qur'an, Hadith and Scholars:Rape</a></div>
<p>There is no equivalent term for ‘rape’ in the Qur'an. Likewise, there is not a single verse in the Qur'an which even remotely discourages forced sex. In contrast, there are several verses in this book which give the green light to rape and other sexual crimes against women. 
</p><p>Qur'an chapter 4 verse 24 discusses lawful and forbidden women for pious Muslims. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess. Thus has Allah ordained for you. All others are lawful, provided you seek them from your property, desiring chastity, not fornication. So with those among them whom you have enjoyed, give them their required due, but if you agree mutually after the requirement (has been determined), there is no sin on you. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.024#004.024">4:24</a></div></div>
<p>What we see in the beginning of this verse as “forbidden” refers to sexual intercourse. The Qur'an dictates, women already married are forbidden for Muslims except those whom their right hands possess (sex slaves). It is obvious from this verse, a Muslim can have sexual relations with his slave-woman. This, along with other verses, apologetic objections, and marital rape (<a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.223#002.223">2:223</a>) is discussed in detail.

<p><b>Al-'Azl</b>, (العزل) also known as <i>coitus interruptus</i>, is the practice of having sexual intercourse with a woman but withdrawing the penis before ejaculation. Apparently this was a pretty important topic for Muhammad and his companions as evidenced by the abundance of Hadith material on the subject.
</p><p>According to Muhammad, when having sex with (i.e. raping) a captive, it's better if you do not pull out the penis at the end.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: that while he was sitting with Allah's Apostle he said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! <b>We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus</b>?&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it.

Muhammad himself declared &quot;A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Women.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> and according to Aisha, &quot;I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Women.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Because of this, domestic violence has been used as a tool to maintain control and dominance over Muslim women, this has created an intensely patriarchal society where men rule women and women must submit to men. In this article we will explore how wife-beating is promoted in the Qur'an and Hadiths along with commentary from Muslim scholars, statistics on wife beating in the Muslim world and common apologetic arguments made by Muslims and responses to them.

<p>This article was written by non-Muslim Arabs in response to the mysterious translation of the verb <i>darb</i> (meaning &quot;hit&quot; &quot;beat&quot; or &quot;strike&quot;) that has been presented on a few sites which claim to have &quot;modern&quot; translations of the Qur'an. These Islamic sites are directed at non-Arabic speakers, as anyone who has an adequate command of the Arabic language will find the claim being presented to be ridiculous.
</p><p>They claim that the following verse (<b>4:34</b>) does not mean &quot;to beat them,&quot; but rather to &quot;separate from them&quot; or to &quot;strike them out.&quot;
</p>
<div class="quotes"><i>&quot;Men are overseers over women, by reason of that wherewith Allah hath made one of them excel over another, and by reason of that which they expend of their substance. Wherefore righteous women are obedient, and are watchers in husbands absence by the aid and protection of Allah. And those wives whose refractoriness ye fear, exhort them, and avoid them in beds, <b>and beat them</b>; but if they obey you, seek not a way against them; verily Allah is ever Lofty, Grand.&quot;</i> <sup id="cite_ref-darayabadi4-34_5-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Women.html#cite_note-darayabadi4-34-5">[5]</a></sup> <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.034#004.034">4:34</a></div></div>
<p><i>Beat them</i> and <i>leave/separate/abandon them</i> are different phrases in Arabic. The arabic word <i>idribohunna</i> derived from the root word <i>Darab</i> does not have any other meaning than <i>Beat</i> when it comes to mean <i>&quot;Yadreb Ahadan&quot;</i> = Hit someone. <i>Idriboohunna</i> <font size="4">(أضربوهن)</font> means beat them (for female plural). <i>Adriboo Anhunna</i> <font size="4">(اضربوا عنهن)</font> is the one that means abandon or leave them. According to the Arabic lexicon.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islam_and_Women.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>:

<p>Quran 4:34 says Idriboohunna <font size="4">أضربوهن</font>, not Adribu Anhunna <font size="4">اضربوا عنهن</font>. These two phrases have different meanings. All the verses that contain darb against a human are understood to mean &quot;beat&quot; or &quot;strike&quot; that human, by their context, and this is agreed upon by these obscure Islamic pseudo-scholars. Why then do they consider verse 4:34 to be a special case and translate &quot;darb&quot; to mean &quot;separate from them&quot;?

<p>Honor Related Violence is physical violence that is inflicted on an individual by perpetrators who believe the victim has brought dishonor upon the family, clan, or community by engaging in any conduct that is perceived as immoral or unacceptable by religious or social/cultural standards. This violence almost always happens in Muslim families.
</p><p>Muslim women are killed for many &quot;honor&quot; related reasons, including being raped, associating with non-related males, getting pregnant outside of marriage, and for the belief they might have done something else immoral. In the eyes of their family this is a capital crime which demands death in order to restore the family's honor. The entire family may all collaborate on this, and in some cases the whole community may participate and even celebrate the occasion.

<p>Muhammad was a polygamist, and Islam allows a man to marry up to four wives at any one time: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four; but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one or what your right hands possess; this is more proper, that you may not deviate from the right course.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.003#004.003">4:3</a></div></div>
<p>It is also interesting to note that a Muslim male does not require the permission of his first wife before marrying a second. These articles analyze the various arguments used by Muslims to defend this practice and the actions of Muhammad.

<p>A common Muslim explanation for 4:3 is to give a partial quote of the verse and explain that a Muslim man <b>may</b> marry up to four women. However, if he cannot deal justly with each of the wives then he is forbidden to marry that many; and can marry only one wife, to prevent treating women unfairly. Muslims explain that the use of the word &quot;Justice&quot; or &quot;Justly&quot; (depending on which translation is being used) refers to the man's ability to treat each of his wives exactly the same in every regard: not just materially (ie. food, clothing, shelter, time, money, etc..) but also that he must be able to love them all exactly the same. He must be able to feel the same amount of affection and love for each of his wives. If he cannot do this, then, according to the Qur'an he cannot marry more than one wife. In reality, Qur'an 4:3 has nothing to do with treating your wives equally, its about the orphan's and their Mahr. Injustice in this verse is talking about financial equality regarding bride price (for orphans) and financial viability of having that many wives, not equality between them.

<p>Zina (Arabic: الزنا‎ ) is the Arabic word for &quot;unlawful sexual relations.&quot;  It is used to refer to both adultery and fornication.
</p><p>The Islamic definition of adultery differs from the modern/secular definition as well as the Biblical definition.  The meaning also differs in relation to gender. Adultery is a serious offense in Islam warranting death to offenders.  However, according to the most widely accepted definitions of the term, Islam in fact allows adultery. Both the Bible and modern, secular definitions of adultery condemn actions that are condoned in the Qur'an, Hadith, and Tafsir. Not only may a Muslim man have sex with a married woman, but he may also sell her as a slave to another man.

<p>Islam prohibits free-mixing between men and women. It is argued that direct references for this prohibition can not be found in either the Qur'an or the Sunnah of the Prophet; but this can not mean that such conduct is permissible in Islam. As a complete way of life, Islam has not failed to address the matter. Various scholars of Islam have formulated their opinions on this matter and acknowledged the practice of free-mixing as a crime punishable under Shari'ah laws. All of the Jurists have sourced their views from the Qur’an and the Sunnah of the prophet, using these as the basis of their argument. Under Islamic law, it is not permissible for women to freely mix or socialize with non-Mahram men (<i>Mahram</i> i.e. those whom marriage is prohibited in Islam, include fathers, uncles, brothers and close blood relatives) under any circumstances. Islamic scholars are unanimous on this matter.

<p>These articles discusses what the Qur'an, hadith and Islamic scholars say about the 72 Virgins, and dispel popular misconceptions surrounding them. The Qur'anic Paradise is sensual in nature, promising Muslim men voluptuous virgins but does not specify their exact number. This cannot possibly be a mistranslation because raisins do not have large eyes or cannot be wed to men. The hadith literature compliment the Qur'anic text by specifying the exact number of virgins as 72 and providing us with detailed descriptions of their characteristics. These narrations are not weak but vary in strength from good to authentic. We are also given details on the physical attributes given to men to sustain 72 virgins, namely, ever-erect penises that never soften and the sexual strength to satisfy 100. Although it does say they will receive a &quot;great reward&quot; and there are also hasan (good) hadith which refer to 72 virgins as one of the &quot;seven blessings from Allah&quot; to the martyr, the Qur'an does not specify these virgins are a reward for jihadists/martyrs, but rather for any Muslim male who gains admittance to Paradise.

<p>Forced marriages are sanctioned in Islam despite what the Muslim apologists claim to the contrary. Shari'a fails to protect the most vulnerable--children. A father's consent is all that is required to marry a young girl to an adult man, and the burden is upon her (once she reaches puberty) to seek an annulment or a divorce. In the meantime, the girl is vulnerable to spousal abuse and childhood pregnancy which greatly jeopardizes her health and future. Child marriages occur all over the world, especially in Muslim countries that practice Shari'a.

<p>In Islamic societies gender segregation is a common practice to avoid any form of adultery. Thus men and women are not advised to stay in the same room if they are alone, and any adult woman is required to wear a veil in public. Only if men and women are closely related (Mahram) or married is there no need for gender segregation and hijab. However, it is obvious that the strict application of Islamic law may cause some trouble and difficulties to daily life, particularly concerning business. However, there is a way around this.

</p><p>From the information provided in the Hadith, we can reasonably conclude that Safiya did not have a choice in this marriage.

<p>When we diligently study the biography of Muhammad and the ahadith we find quite a few examples where Muhammad had openly transgressed the provisions of the Qur'an. Sex was an important aspect of Muhammad’s life. His unbridled indulgence in sex had, on many occasions, forced him to violate Allah’s rule overtly. To suppress his breach of the Qur’anic laws on sex and sexuality, he, as usual, concocted stories of Allah’s exemption to his dearest friend. This article exposes the hypocrisy of some Islamists who claim adamantly that Muhammad could have never violated the Qur’an. What you will find are numerous examples of how Muhammad had violated the Qur’an vis-à-vis sex.
