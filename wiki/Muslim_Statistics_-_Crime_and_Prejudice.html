<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Norway">Norway</span></h3>
<p>Jews in Oslo are more than 6 times more likely than Muslims to experience harassment.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Oslo Jewish Community leaders allege an Islamic organisation is glossing over anti-Semitism in Norwegian schools by focusing more on Muslim harassment.
<p>The current row started on Tuesday [June 7, 2011], after Oslo municipality presented a report charting racist and anti-Semitic attitudes amongst 7,212 pupils in 48 secondary schools. 
</p><p><b>Results show 33.3 percent of Jews experience harassment between two and three times per month, compared with 5.3 percent of Muslims.</b>
</p><p>According to Vårt Land, Ervin Kohn of Oslo’s Jewish Community (DMT) was discouraged by the report. Despite the high figures, however, Secretary General of umbrella organisation Islamsk Råd Norway (IRN), Mehtab Afsar, claims, “it’s really the Muslims that are given a hard time, and charting Muslim harassment is well overdue.”
</p><p>The day after the report came out, pro-integration network LIM (Likestilling, Integrering, Mangfold) said it encourages all actors to fight against what it views as increasing anti-Semitism in Norway. At the same time, it was openly critical to Mr Afsar’s statements.
</p><p>“Unfortunately, it seems as though IRN neither intends to recognize or take the problem of anti-Semitism seriously. Secretary General Afsar would rather focus more upon intimidation of Muslims.”
</p><p>In a further development in what was becoming a growing rift between two ethnic minorities IRN issued a press statement yesterday, also censuring its own Secretary General, saying, “We wish to state once and for all that we clearly distance ourselves from all types of bullying and harassment, including anti-Semitism. 
</p><p>IRN apologises that some individuals have tried to turn a general societal problem into a particularly Muslim one,” it continues.
</p>
“I cannot see that IRN takes anti-Semitism seriously when reading this press release,” says Mr Ervin Kohn<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</span></h3>
<p>Hate crimes against Muslims in the United Kingdom appear to be dropping, not going up
</p>
<div class="quotes">Here, for instance, are the figures for race and/or faith hate offences in London’s main Muslim borough, Tower Hamlets. The majority of these, of course, would not have been crimes of violence.
<p>2003/4                      <b>694</b>
</p><p>2004/5                      <b>600</b>
</p><p>2006/7                       <b>632</b>
</p><p>2007/8                       <b>440</b>
</p><p>2008/9                      <b>373</b>
</p><p>2009/10                    <b>353</b>
</p><p>I chose Tower Hamlets because the vast majority of its non-white population is Muslim, and therefore most of the victims here would have been Muslim. And the truth, in this borough at least, is the polar opposite of what Lambert and Githens-Mazer claim. In this Muslim area, <b>there has been a 50% reduction in hate crime</b>.
</p><p>The figures for the first four years are from April to April and are from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mpa.gov.uk/partnerships/hcf/rhcf/">annual reports</a> of the Metropolitan Police Authority’s Race Hate Crime Forum. The figures for the last two years are October to October from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.met.police.uk/crimefigures/datatable.php?borough=ht&period=year?borough=ht&period=year">Met Police website</a>.
</p><p>In England and Wales as a whole, according to the latest Home Office statistics, the number of <b>racially or religiously aggravated offences has fallen by 11.4 per cent over the last four years</b> for which figures are available (page 20 of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.justice.gov.uk/stats-race-and-the-criminal-justice-system-2008-09c1.pdf&date=2011-06-13?url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.justice.gov.uk/stats-race-and-the-criminal-justice-system-2008-09c1.pdf&date=2011-06-13">this PDF</a>.)
</p>
As I say, statistics for purely faith hate crime alone going back over a long period are harder to find. But the latest online minutes of the Tower Hamlets Interfaith Forum, for the meeting held on 5 October 2010, show that in the months of August and September there were – wait for it – a grand total of seven faith hate crimes reported to the police in the borough, not all of which from the description in fact appear to be faith hate crimes. The previous minutes, for the 15 June meeting, showed a total of <b>eight faith hate crimes between April 1 and June 14, of which only two were against Muslims</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">December 2010</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Yesterday’s Independent on Sunday had an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/muslims-call-for-action-against-hate-crimes-2296477.html&date=2011-06-13?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/muslims-call-for-action-against-hate-crimes-2296477.html&date=2011-06-13">alarming story</a> claiming that “Islamophobic attacks have been on the rise.” It previewed a speech in which Farooq Murad, head of the Muslim Council of Britain, was due to say: “Islamophobic attacks, on persons and properties, are committed by a tiny minority, but the number of incidents is increasing. Robust action is necessary.”
<p>However, the same article quoted some interesting figures from the Metropolitan Police – the first I’ve seen on specifically Islamophobic incidents – which diametrically contradict both Mr Murad’s claim and the Sindy’s own. The paper said there had been “762 Islamophobic offences in London since April 2009, including 333 in 2010/11 and 57 since this April.” It said there were only a few forces which collect this data; figures from the other forces weren’t given.
</p><p>If a total of 762 offences have been committed since April 2009, 57 of them since this April and 333 of them in 2010/11, that means the number committed in 2009/10 was 372. <b>Between 09/10 and 10/11 there was therefore a drop of 39 offences – or more than 10 per cent</b>.
</p>
I have to suspect, from the unusual way the paper presented the figures, that either it or the MCB was trying to conceal this inconvenient truth.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2011</div></div>
<p>75% of anti-Muslim &quot;hate crimes&quot; recorded by the government-backed Tell Mama are in fact &quot;offensive&quot; internet comments on sites such as Twitter.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Three-quarters of the [anti-Muslim] incidents recorded by Tell Mama occurred online, with Twitter particularly highlighted as a source of abuse.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">March 2013</div></div>
<p>The highly publicized &quot;wave of attacks&quot; on Muslims after the Woolwich terror attack were in fact mostly incidents of &quot;offensive&quot; online comments, some not even originating from the UK. And reliable statistics covering 2009-2012 show anti-Muslim hate crimes are continuing to drop. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Tell Mama confirmed to The Sunday Telegraph that <b>about 120 of its 212 “anti-Muslim incidents” – 57 per cent – took place only online.</b> They were offensive postings on Twitter or Facebook, or comments on blogs: nasty and undesirable, certainly, but some way from violence or physical harm and often, indeed, legal. <b>Not all the offending tweets and postings, it turns out, even originated in Britain</b>.<br>. . .<br>
<p>Mr Mughal admitted that a further <b>35 of the 212 post-Woolwich incidents, or 16 per cent, had yet to be verified</b>...<b>Fewer than one in 12 of the 212 “incidents” reported to Tell Mama since Woolwich – 17 cases (8 per cent) – involved individuals being physically targeted.</b>
<b>Six people had things thrown at them, said Mr Mughal, and most of the other 11 cases were attempts to pull off the hijab or other items of Islamic dress.</b>
Without in any way denying the distress and harm caused by such attacks, they do stand at the lower levels of seriousness.<br>. . .<br>
<b>Asking other police forces and trawling local media reports, The Telegraph has been unable to find a single confirmed case since Drummer Rigby’s death where any individual Muslim has received an injury requiring medical treatment</b>.
</p>
Tell Mama’s Twitter feed reported one such incident, of a Muslim woman “knocked unconscious” in Bolton, but the <b>local police said they had no knowledge of this and did not believe it happened</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2013</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>A controversial project claiming to measure anti-Muslim attacks will not have its government grant renewed after police and civil servants raised concerns about its methods.</b>
<p>The project, called Tell Mama, claimed that there had been a “sustained wave of attacks and intimidation” against British Muslims after the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby, with 193 “Islamophobic incidents” reported to it, rising to 212 by last weekend.
</p><p>The group’s founder, Fiyaz Mughal, said he saw “no end to this cycle of violence”, describing it as “unprecedented”. The claims were unquestioningly repeated in the media.
</p><p>Tell Mama and Mr Mughal did not mention, however, that <b>57 per cent of the 212 reports referred to activity that took place only online, mainly offensive postings on Twitter and Facebook, or that a further 16 per cent of the 212 reports had not been verified. Not all the online abuse even originated in Britain.</b>
</p><p><b>Contrary to the group’s claim of a “cycle of violence” and a “sustained wave of attacks”, only 17 of the 212 incidents, 8 per cent, involved the physical targeting of people and there were no attacks on anyone serious enough to require medical treatment.</b><br>. . .<br>
The Sunday Telegraph has now learned that even before Woolwich, the communities minister, the Liberal Democrat MP Don Foster, called Mr Mughal to a meeting and said that Tell Mama’s grant would not be renewed.
</p><p>The organisation has received a total of £375,000 from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) since last year.
</p><p>“<b>Mr Mughal was giving data on attacks to DCLG which wasn’t stacking up when it was cross-referenced with other reports by Acpo [the Association of Chief Police Officers]</b>,” said one source closely involved in counter-extremism.
</p><p>“He was questioned by DCLG civil servants and lost his temper. He was subsequently called in by Don Foster and told that he would receive no more money.”
</p><p>A senior Liberal Democrat source confirmed the sequence of events, saying: “There was a bit of a spat. He was called in and told that Acpo had cast doubt on his figures. He was told that he would be closely monitored for the remaining period of the grant and that there would be no more money.”
</p><p>A DCLG spokesman confirmed that Tell Mama’s funding would not be renewed and refused to deny that officials had raised concerns about its methods.
</p><p>Tell Mama claimed in March that anti-Muslim crime was “rising”, even though the group had only been in operation at that stage for a year and had no previous figures to compare with.
</p><p><b>Other figures, collected by the police, show that hate crime in mainly Muslim areas has fallen in the past 10 years. The only large force that collects figures on specifically anti-Muslim crime, the Metropolitan Police, reported an 8.5 per cent fall in such crimes between 2009 and 2012.</b>
</p><p>There was a spike in anti-Muslim incidents after the killing of Drummer Rigby. However, contrary to Tell Mama’s claims that it was “unprecedented”, the Met’s assistant commissioner, Cressida Dick, told MPs last week that it was “slightly less” than after previous terror attacks.
</p><p>“There has not been such a very big increase in attacks as we might have feared,” she said. Mr Mughal himself has now admitted to the BBC that the number of physical attacks was “small”.
</p><p>Tell Mama has also been using its budget to threaten members of the public with libel actions for criticising it on Twitter.
</p><p>In mid-May, before Woolwich, one Jewish activist, Ambrosine Chetrit, received a threatening letter from solicitors after she tweeted that “Tell Mama are sitting on Twitter on the EDL hashtag, threatening anyone and everyone whose comments they do not like about Islam”.
Tell Mama also objected to a tweet in which Ms Chetrit said it was “trying to close down pro-Israel [Twitter] accounts daily”.
</p><p>Other recipients of legal threats at the same time include Atma Singh, a former race adviser to the then Labour mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, who received a legal letter from Tell Mama after tweeting that it “gives a platform to Islamists”.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
The letters were written by Farooq Bajwa, a solicitor who has acted for a number of Islamists and Islamist sympathisers, including the Palestinian radical leader Raed Salah and the Respect MP George Galloway.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">June 2013</div></div>

<p>Most Muslims are reluctant organ donors, yet are eager recipients. Once of the reasons given is the belief that you should not deface the human body. Apparently the defacement of the bodies of non-Muslims are fine with most of the Muslims who believe this. And almost a quarter of those surveyed said they would only want to donate an organ if they knew it was going to another Muslim.
</p>
<div class="quotes"><b>Of all religious groups, Muslims are the most resistant to organ donation</b>, largely because they're confused about whether it's permitted within their faith, a British medical expert told delegates to an international transplantation conference in Vancouver Tuesday.
<p>Dr. Adnan Sharif, a Muslim kidney specialist completing his training, led an international survey to find out why Muslims agree with organ donation, and would happily accept a transplant, but aren't so keen on consenting to being donors.
</p><p>In his presentation to delegates at the 23rd international congress of the Transplantation Society, Sharif said <b>nearly three-quarters of the 891 participants in the survey said they would be glad to receive an organ if needed but only 10.6 per cent of respondents were registered organ donors</b>.
<br>. . .<br>
&quot;<b>Muslims have this argument, this belief, that organ donation is a sin even though most scholars say it's okay</b>, and in fact welcome, because of the belief that to save one life is to save all humanity.
</p><p>&quot;Transplantation obviously did not exist when the Koran was written. There is a line that says you shouldn't deface the human body. It is a reference to ancient Arab practices of defacing bodies after death. I think people do use that as an excuse not to be organ donors,&quot; said Sharif, who conducted the survey with four colleagues from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England.
<br>. . .<br>
The online and printed survey, which solicited respondents through word of mouth, social networking, Muslim organizations and mosques, is expected to be published in a medical journal soon. He said the survey detected some disturbing attitudes that would appear to be based on prejudice. For instance, <b>almost a quarter of respondents said they would only want to donate an organ if they knew it was going to another Muslim. About 10 per cent said they would prefer to receive an organ from a fellow Muslim</b>.
</p>
&quot;It's a help-your-own kind of attitude, but to direct an organ to a certain individual is not only unethical, but illegal.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muslim_Statistics_-_Crime_and_Prejudice.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">August 2010</div></div>

Muslims across all the regions surveyed also generally agree that certain behaviors –such as suicide, homosexuality and consuming alcohol– are morally unacceptable...
