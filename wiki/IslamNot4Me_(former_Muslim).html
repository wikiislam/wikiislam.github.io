<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Testimony_of_Leaving_Islam">Testimony of Leaving Islam</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I was a Muslim born in an Islamic country - fortunately a much more liberal country compared to those in the Middle East. My father was previously a Christian before he converted to marry my mother. Hence the multi-racial family I have. Mostly Christian but also some Hindu. My mother's side all Muslims. 
</p><p>I had my doubts of the religion ever since I was a little girl of 7 or 8. At a young age...  My family even though a Muslim they are quite open. I was always thought to be kind to people and God loves EVERY AND EACH ONE OF HIS CREATIONS. That's what I knew for the beginning of my early life. But from the time I started school which was at 7 then I started to go to religious classes. That's when I know about how ALLAH hates unbelievers. As a child I thought, if He loves every and each one of us, if he is so Almighty why didn't He just make every one a believer? Make the unbelievers barren? I don't remember choosing who my parents. What purpose is it that just to create Humans for burning them in Hell? Plus, if a person is kind why judge him or her by what she believes? 
This is because of the hatred the Muslims always portray for those of other religion. I think the only religion that has many names for those who are not a follower is Islam. Maybe Christians too call names to unbelievers, but not as horrible as the Muslims. Kaffir, Infidel, unbeliever, apostate, hell dweller, you name it. Every day I go for religious class the Ustaz or Ustazah will tell how you will go into hell if you do not follow the teachings of Islam, or how Allah hates non-believers and they will become the fuel of hell. The teaching of Islam is instilled by fear, guilt and hate. As a child it was hard for me to accept this because my non-Muslim family is a lot kinder than my Muslim family. Not saying that all Muslims I know are horrible people. Many are kind, but I truly believe Islam brings out the worse in them. 
</p><p>However, it was not till I am in my early 20's that I really say &quot;Islam is not for me&quot; and I think it shouldn't be for anyone who wants truth. It was in my 20's that I faced challenging times in my life that I search for comfort from the religion. I read the Quran from 1st page to last and I even read about the life of the so called &quot;prophet&quot; Muhammad because I want to be near to the religion. It is just unbelievable, how billions of Muslims could overlook so many flaws. 
</p><p>Like the 50 plus, perverted old 'prophet' of theirs having sex with a 9 year old. They can argue all they want about the age of Ayesha or that she already reached puberty and what not. A child is a child. Thanks to this old perverted coot, so many little girls became victim of child marriages. May Muhammad rot in hell (if there is one). 
</p><p>Another is about him marrying his own adopted son's wife. The amazing thing is, when he did that, suddenly Allah sent Surah 33 - The confederates. So that to &quot;avoid scandal&quot;. Yeah right.....  Isn't that convenient? He did something that people will question; a new Surah comes to 'avoid scandal'. He's a true blue sex maniac that's all he was. He had wives as young as 6 years old to an old woman 15 years his senior. He tried them all.
</p><p>No prophet of mine is a sex maniac. That's it. Islam is not for me. 
</p><p>Sometimes I think it is just self-denial, not wanting to be called a Kaffir (seems to be such a degrading word, lower than animals according to the Muslims), that people just afraid to search for truth.
</p><p>NOW:
</p><p>I did look back. What if I'm wrong?  Some part of me said that Islam isn't a bad religion if I just overlook the big flaws, further there are so many nice Muslims. That's what I did, overlook the bad things. To be ignorant is bliss. You just do the 5 compulsory things required in Islam and fight against those who insult Islam. 
</p><p>But the more I read the more I see the contradiction. Even the Muslims helped strengthen the decision with their deeds. A bunch of self-denying hypocrites! Reading news about how Muslims kill other Muslims, little girls of under 10 seeking help because married to men 30-40 years older them, throwing of acid of girls just because they want to go to school, etc. Don't tell me Islam don't teach this. That's bull.
My mom taught me the religion. But as many other Muslims my mother was one of those who didn't even know that Muhammad had 13 wives and concubines. When I mentioned it, many Muslims say that cannot be and it's a lie.  He only had 4. Never were we taught about Muhammad sleeping with his slaves whom he did not marry. Because: it's so against our culture. Islam supposed to be pure and clean. Sleeping with slaves would be stag that would make people &quot;think'. Not good to &quot;think&quot; according to Islam, that's the whispering of Satan. LOL No wonders they are so backward in many things.
</p><p>But as I said not till I was in my 20's that I began to really 'look'.
Muslims really do like to judge others as if they 100% sure what is going to happen in the after world. The last straw I had when I argued with short-sighted Muslims because of the Hamas and Israel war recently. I didn't like what Israel was doing, killing innocents. But Hamas was to be blamed as well. You see, Israel had said they attack if the rockets don't stop coming into southern Israel. Hamas continued to send rocket in. 
</p><p>Do you know what's their argument? Hamas only launched rockets but Israel sent in battalions. Hamas killed a few but Israel kills thousands. KILL ALL JEW! (These people are liberal Muslims, not from the radical side. Liberal..?? Geez ALL Muslims love to see non-Muslim blood on the ground in the name of Allah)
</p><p>I tried to tell them. If you only have rockets and stupid soldiers who can't even hit a target why must you keep on provoking your enemy who has tanks, fighter jets, etc?? You send one rocket and kill 1-2 Jews, and they fire back and kill 300 of your people, you send another rocket you kill 2-3 Jews, they fire back and kill 500 of your innocent people, would you fire again?? 
</p><p>Their answer - It's your opinion and it's up to you want you want to believe. Hamas is a Muslim group and we support Muslims. SEE, this is how they conclude things. Even if a Muslim does wrong they still support. They TRY ALL THEY CAN TO JUSTIFY A MUSLIM EVIL DEED. If a non-Muslim does something wrong (just saying their opinion openly about Islam for example. Only Muslim can condemn other religion openly and get away with it) , all hell breaks loose - burning of flags, rioting, fatwa to have the people responsible heads on a platter etc. 
</p><p>Why aren't they making noise when a Muslim girl of 8 recently asking for divorce from her 40 something old husband? And the court in Saudi Arabia didn't allow that? This isn't a unique case. 
</p><p>Why aren't they making any noise when Muslim boys threw acid on Muslim girls' faces who wants to go to school to make their lives and their country better?? Where are they??
</p><p>Why aren't they making noise when Muslim suicide bombers kill other Muslims? Including children and women?
</p><p><b>I think I had enough.</b> I don't want to be associated with this religion of hate. They even hate those of their own belief just because they do something differently. It's a religion of Ego and morons who think with their asses instead of their heads.
</p><p>My father didn't follow any of those craps. As for the other family, they don't know I said goodbye to the religion. Perhaps better to keep it that way for now. You can imagine how the Muslims can go berserk if they know.
</p><p><br>
