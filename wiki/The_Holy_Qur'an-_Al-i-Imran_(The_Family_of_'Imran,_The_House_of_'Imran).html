</p><p>In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:1"> <sup>1</sup></span> 
Alif Lam Mim. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:2"> <sup>2</sup></span> 
Allah! There is no god but He,-the Living, the Self-Subsisting, Eternal. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:3"> <sup>3</sup></span> 
It is He Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong). 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:4"> <sup>4</sup></span> 
Then those who reject Faith in the Signs of Allah will suffer the severest penalty, and Allah is Exalted in Might, Lord of Retribution. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:5"> <sup>5</sup></span> 
From Allah, verily nothing is hidden on earth or in the heavens. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:6"> <sup>6</sup></span> 
He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:7"> <sup>7</sup></span> 
He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: &quot;We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord:&quot; and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:8"> <sup>8</sup></span> 
&quot;Our Lord!&quot; (they say), &quot;Let not our hearts deviate now after Thou hast guided us, but grant us mercy from Thine own Presence; for Thou art the Grantor of bounties without measure. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:9"> <sup>9</sup></span> 
&quot;Our Lord! Thou art He that will gather mankind Together against a day about which there is no doubt; for Allah never fails in His promise.&quot; 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:10"> <sup>10</sup></span> 
Those who reject Faith,- neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against Allah: They are themselves but fuel for the Fire. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:11"> <sup>11</sup></span> 
(Their plight will be) no better than that of the people of Pharaoh, and their predecessors: They denied our Signs, and Allah called them to account for their sins. For Allah is strict in punishment. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:12"> <sup>12</sup></span> 
Say to those who reject Faith: &quot;Soon will ye be vanquished and gathered together to Hell,-an evil bed indeed (to lie on)! 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:13"> <sup>13</sup></span> 
&quot;There has already been for you a Sign in the two armies that met (in combat): One was fighting in the cause of Allah, the other resisting Allah; these saw with their own eyes Twice their number.

To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:181"> <sup>181</sup></span> 
Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: &quot;Truly, Allah is indigent and we are rich!&quot;- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: &quot;Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire! 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:182"> <sup>182</sup></span> 
&quot;This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never harms those who serve Him.&quot; 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:183"> <sup>183</sup></span> 
They (also) said: &quot;Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven).&quot; Say: &quot;There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?&quot; 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:184"> <sup>184</sup></span> 
Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:185"> <sup>185</sup></span> 
Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:186"> <sup>186</sup></span> 
Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs.<sup><a href="wiki/List_of_Abrogations_in_the_Qur'an.html#Surah_3" title="List of Abrogations in the Qur'an"><font color="darkred"><b>X</b></font></a></sup>

And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made! 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:188"> <sup>188</sup></span> 
Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and who love to be praised for what they have not done; that they can escape the penalty. For them is a penalty Grievous indeed.<sup><a href="wiki/Revelational_Circumstances_of_the_Qur'an-_Surah_3_(Al-i-Imran).html#3:188" title="Revelational Circumstances of the Qur'an: Surah 3 (Al-i-Imran)"><font color="green"><b>R</b></font></a></sup>

</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:191"> <sup>191</sup></span> 
Men who celebrate the praises of Allah, standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in the heavens and the earth, (With the thought): &quot;Our Lord! not for naught Hast Thou created (all) this! Glory to Thee! Give us salvation from the penalty of the Fire. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:192"> <sup>192</sup></span> 
&quot;Our Lord! any whom Thou dost admit to the Fire, Truly Thou coverest with shame, and never will wrong-doers Find any helpers! 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:193"> <sup>193</sup></span> 
&quot;Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling (Us) to Faith, 'Believe ye in the Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, blot out from us our iniquities, and take to Thyself our souls in the company of the righteous. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:194"> <sup>194</sup></span> 
&quot;Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thine messengers, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou never breakest Thy promise.&quot; 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:195"> <sup>195</sup></span> 
And their Lord hath accepted of them, and answered them: &quot;Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: Ye are members, one of another: Those who have left their homes, or been driven out therefrom, or suffered harm in My Cause, or fought or been slain,- verily, I will blot out from them their iniquities, and admit them into Gardens with rivers flowing beneath;- A reward from the presence of Allah, and from His presence is the best of rewards.&quot;<sup><a href="wiki/Contradictions_in_the_Qur'an.html#Are_men_and_women_equal.3F" title="Contradictions in the Qur'an" class="mw-redirect"><font color="purple"><b>E</b></font></a></sup>

Let not the strutting about of the Unbelievers through the land deceive thee: 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:197"> <sup>197</sup></span> 
Little is it for enjoyment: Their ultimate abode is Hell: what an evil bed (To lie on)! 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:198"> <sup>198</sup></span> 
On the other hand, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath; therein are they to dwell (for ever),- a gift from the presence of Allah; and that which is in the presence of Allah is the best (bliss) for the righteous. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:199"> <sup>199</sup></span> 
And there are, certainly, among the People of the Book, those who believe in Allah, in the revelation to you, and in the revelation to them, bowing in humility to Allah: They will not sell the Signs of Allah for a miserable gain! For them is a reward with their Lord, and Allah is swift in account. 
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="3:200"> <sup>200</sup></span> 
O ye who believe! Persevere in patience and constancy; vie in such perseverance; strengthen each other; and fear Allah; that ye may prosper.
