<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><b>Anti-Semitism</b> is deeply rooted within Islamic scripture. According to Islamic theology, the Jews are one of the &quot;<a href="wiki/Islam_and_the_People_of_the_Book.html" title="Islam and the People of the Book">People of the Book</a>&quot;, who were given the <a href="wiki/Taurat.html" title="Taurat">Taurat</a> which was revealed by <a href="wiki/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> to Musa (Moses). Initially Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad's</a> attitude towards the People of the Book, the Jews and the Christians, was a positive one. However, having encountered rejection from the Jewish scholars after his hijra (migration) to Medina, this positive view slowly began to fade. The Jews were skeptical of the compatibility between the Qur'an and their own scriptures, and while many in Medina converted to Islam, very few were from the large Jewish populations. This period marked the beginning of the long history of ridicule, persecution, and subjugation of Jews by the followers of Islam.

<p>Technically, Arabs, Ethiopians, and Assyrians can be described as Semitic people, however in the context of &quot;Anti-Semitism&quot; it is commonly understood to refer to people who identify as Jewish.

<p><b>Worldwide</b>
</p><p>Anti-Semitic incidents around the world have more than doubled in 2009 over the previous year, and most violent attacks in Western Europe comes from people of Arab or Muslim heritage.
</p>
<div class="quotes">Anti-Semitic incidents around the world more than doubled in 2009 over the previous year, posting their worst year since monitoring began two decades ago, according to a new survey.<br>. . .<br>
<p>In Europe, Britain and France led with the number of incidents, according to the report. There were 374 violent incidents against Jews recorded in Britain in 2009, compared to 112 in 2008, according to the institute. France saw 195 attacks in 2009 compared to 50 the previous year. Britain and France have the highest Jewish populations in Europe, as well as the largest Muslim populations.
</p>
Only 78 incidents of anti-Semitic violence were recorded in 1989, the year that the institute began recording such incidents. In 2009, some 41 of the incidents were armed assaults directed at Jews because of their religion; 34 incidents were arson, according to the report.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes">A major annual study of worldwide anti-Semitic incidents points to a dramatic rise in anti-Semitism in 2009, with particularly steep jumps in Western Europe and Canada.<br>. . .<br>
<p>The year in the wake of Operation Cast Lead was the worst since monitoring of anti-Semitic manifestations began, in terms of both major anti-Semitic violence and the hostile atmosphere generated worldwide by the mass demonstrations and verbal and visual expressions against Israel and the Jews,&quot; the report said.
</p><p>The report, considered an important bellwether of anti-Jewish sentiment worldwide, was released ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day in cooperation with the European Jewish Congress (EJC).
</p><p>Among its most dramatic findings was a 102 percent increase in anti-Jewish violence worldwide, from 559 incidents in 2008 to 1,129 in 2009.
</p><p>In addition, there were &quot;many more hundreds of threats, insults, graffiti signs and slogans and demonstrations featuring virulently anti-Semitic content... sometimes resulting in violence,&quot; according to the report.
</p><p>A significant part of this increase took place in the UK, where violence jumped from 112 incidents in 2008 to 374 last year; in France, where the jump was from 50 to 195, and in Canada, where incidents soared from 13 to 138.
</p><p>The US, which ordinarily enjoys a very low rate of anti-Jewish violence compared to the size of its Jewish community, nonetheless saw a modest rise, from 98 to 116 incidents.
</p><p>In some countries, these figures are only the latest spike in a continuing trend. The British Jewish community's monitoring system counted a three-fold increase in anti-Semitic occurrences since 1999, while Canada counted a five-fold increase since 2000.
</p><p><b>Most violent attacks in Western Europe came from people of Arab or Muslim heritage, the report found</b>.<br>. . .<br>
</p><p>In 2009, however, “white” attacks [in the UK] dropped to 48% and “Asian” or “Arab” attacks jumped to 43%.
</p>
During the month of January 2009, in the midst of Operation Cast Lead, <b>“Asian” and “Arab” attackers accounted for fully 54% of incidents, although the Muslim community numbers just 4% of the general population</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p>Experience has taught him that the boys taunting him are almost always of Moroccan descent.

“Their reasoning goes something like this: Israelis are Jews, Palestinians are Arabs, so we Moroccan ‘Arabs’ in the Netherlands are going to take on Dutch Jews,” said Menno ten Brink, a rabbi for the liberal Jewish community in Amsterdam.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p>Jews leaving Sweden as Hate crimes double 
</p>
<div class="quotes">When she first arrived in Sweden after her rescue from a Nazi concentration camp, Judith Popinski was treated with great kindness. 
<p>She raised a family in the city of Malmo, and for the next six decades lived happily in her adopted homeland - until last year.
</p><p>In 2009, a chapel serving the city's 700-strong Jewish community was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused on their way home from prayer, and &quot;Hitler&quot; was mockingly chanted in the streets by masked men. 
</p><p>&quot;I never thought I would see this hatred again in my lifetime, not in Sweden anyway,&quot; Mrs Popinski told The Sunday Telegraph. 
</p><p>&quot;<b>This new hatred comes from Muslim immigrants</b>. The Jewish people are afraid now.&quot;
<br>. . .<br>
The future looks so bleak that by one estimate, around <b>30 Jewish families have already left for Stockholm, England or Israel</b>, and more are preparing to go. 
</p><p>With its young people planning new lives elsewhere, the remaining Jewish households, many of whom are made up of Holocaust survivors and their descendants, fear they will soon be gone altogether. Mrs Popinski, an 86-year-old widow, said she has even encountered hostility when invited to talk about the Holocaust in schools. 
</p><p>&quot;Muslim schoolchildren often ignore me now when I talk about my experiences in the camps,&quot; she said. &quot;It is because of what their parents tell them about Jews. The hatreds of the Middle East have come to Malmo. Schools in Muslim areas of the city simply won't invite Holocaust survivors to speak any more.&quot; 
</p><p><b>Hate crimes, mainly directed against Jews, doubled last year</b> with Malmo's police recording 79 incidents and admitting that far more probably went unreported. As of yet, no direct attacks on people have been recorded but many Jews believe it is only a matter of time in the current climate.
<br>. . .<br>
After the war, just as liberal Sweden took in Jews who survived the Holocaust as a humanitarian act, it also took in new waves of refugees from tyranny and conflicts in the Middle East. Muslims are now estimated to make up about a fifth of Malmo's population of nearly 300,000. 
</p><p>&quot;This new hatred from a group 40,000-strong is focused on a small group of Jews,&quot; Mrs Popinski said, speaking in a sitting room filled with paintings and Persian carpets. 
</p>
&quot;Some Swedish politicians are letting them do it, including the mayor. Of course the Muslims have more votes than the Jews.&quot;<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">February, 2010</div></div>
<div class="quotes">A March 29 story in The Washington Times (“Hate Crimes Force Jews Out of Malmo”) noted that of 115 bias-crimes in Sweden’s third largest city, reported in 2009, 52 were anti-Semitic, this notwithstanding that Malmo’s Jewish population numbers fewer than 700 (half of what it was two decades ago) in a general population of 280,000. 
<p>Thus, <b>Jews represent less than .0025% of the city, but account for 45% of all hate crimes</b>. Could that have something to do with Malmo’s 60,000 Muslims? 
</p>
Malmo Rabbi Shneur Kesselman says: “<b>In the past five years I’ve been here, I think you can count on your hand how many (anti-Semitic) incidents there have been from the extreme right. In my personal experience, it’s 99% Muslim.</b>” Jewish resident Marcus Eilenberg, whose survivor grandparents found shelter in Malmo in 1945, says Jews there are confronting “a degree of hate that none of us – except those who survived the Holocaust – had experienced before.”<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>United Kingdom</b>
</p><p>About 2 out of 5 British Muslims believe Jews are &quot;a legitimate target&quot;
</p>
<div class="quotes">Nearly two fifths (37 per cent) [of Muslims] believe that the Jewish community in Britain is a legitimate target “as part of the ongoing struggle for justice in the Middle East”. Moreover, only 52 per cent think that the state of Israel has the right to exist, with 30 per cent disagreeing, a big minority. One in six of all Muslims questioned thinks suicide bombings can sometimes be justified in Israel, though many fewer (7 per cent) say the same about Britain. This is broadly comparable to the number justifying suicide attacks in ICM and YouGov polls of British Muslims after the July 7 attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-Jews_UK_11-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-Jews_UK-11">[11]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">February, 2006</div></div>
<p>Antisemitism reaches an all time high in the UK
</p>
<div class="quotes">Attacks on Britain’s Jews have risen to the highest level since records began.
<p>A study published today shows the number of reported anti-Semitic incidents has almost tripled in 10 years, with more than half the attacks last year taking place in London.
The findings prompted the report’s authors to warn of a “wave of hatred” against Jews.
The number of incidents increased to 594 last year, up by 31 per cent on the previous year.
</p>
Violent assaults soared to 112, up by more than a third on 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Islamic_Antisemitism.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">February, 2007</div></div>

Their efforts to bring together all the forces hostile to Islam in an unholy affiance, with the aim of exterminating Islam altogether, are well known.
<p>They have continued to scheme against Islam and the Muslim community ever since. They were instrumental in the chaotic events that led to the assassination of the third rightly-guided Caliph.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The belief in Allah and the Last Day is one of the pillars of Faith in Islam. The Qur'an tells us Allah has cursed the Jews with enmity and hatred until that Day of Judgment, and the sahih hadith tell us that this day will not come unless the Muslims fight and slaughter the Jews. So, from a scriptural and theological perspective, Muslims has to believe in the total annihilation of Jews. We are further told that Muslims will be saved on the Day of Resurrection by throwing Jews into hell-fire. 
</p><p>It is dictated to Muslims by their holy scripture and other authentic sources to hate the Jews until the end of times then to massacre them with the help of talking stones and trees. Hatred of Jews is a holy ordinance for Muslims. Throughout Islamic history, this has been acknowledged by its scholars.
