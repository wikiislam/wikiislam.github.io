&quot;<b>The hadd is imposed for drinking wine even if it does not make the man intoxicated. That is because he drank it to become intoxicated</b>.

<div class="quotes">Narrated byMu'adh ibn Jabal:
Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) instructed me to do ten things saying: 1. Do not associate anything with Allah even if you are killed and burnt on that account. 2. Don't be disobedient to your parents even if they command you to abandon your family and your property. 3. Do not deliberately neglect to observe a prescribed prayer for he who neglects the prescribed prayer deliberately will become out of the protection of Allah. 4. <b>Do not drink wine for it is the height of every obscenity</b>. 5. Shun evil, for with evil there descends the wrath of Allah. 6. Beware of running away from the battle-field even if the people perish. 7. And when the death overtakes the people (in a plague or disaster) and you are one amongst them, show steadfastness. 8. Spend on your children according to your means. 9. Do not refrain from using pressure (of punishment) with a view to training them. 10. Inculcate in them the fear of Allah.

Yet, he still said, &quot;O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.&quot; Then, the Ayah that is in Surat Al-Ma'idah was revealed, Umar was again summoned and the Ayah was recited to him.

</p><p><i>(So, will you not then abstain) (5:91)</i> he said, &quot;We did abstain, we did abstain.&quot; This is also the narration that Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasai collected in their books. `Ali bin Al-Madini and At-Tirmidhi said that the chain of narrators for this Hadith is sound and authentic. We will mention this Hadith again along with what Imam Ahmad collected by Abu Hurayrah Allah's saying in Surat Al-Ma'idah:
</p><p>[إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ]

</p><p>As for Al-Khamr, `Umar bin Khattab, the Leader of the faithful, used to say, &quot;It includes all what intoxicates the mind.&quot; We will also mention this statement in the explanation of Surat Al-Ma'idah, along with the topic of gambling.
</p><p>Allah said:
</p><p>[قُلْ فِيهِمَآ إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَمَنَـفِعُ لِلنَّاسِ]
</p><p><i>(Say: In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men.)</i>
</p><p>As for the harm that the Khamr and gambling cause, it effects the religion. As for their benefit, it is material, including benefit for the body, digesting the food, getting rid of the excrements, sharpening the mind, bringing about a joyous sensation and financially benefiting from their sale. Also, (their benefit includes) earnings through gambling that one uses to spend on his family and on himself. Yet, these benefits are outweighed by the clear harm that they cause which affects the mind and the religion. This is why Allah said:

</p><p><i>(...but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.)</i>
</p><p>This Ayah was the beginning of the process of prohibiting Khamr, not explicity, but it only implied this meaning. So when this Ayah was recited to `Umar, he still said, &quot;O Allah! Give us a clear ruling regarding Al-Khamr.&quot; Soon after, Allah sent down a clear prohibition of Khamr in Surat Al-Ma'idah:
</p><p>[يَـأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالاٌّنصَابُ وَالاٌّزْلاَمُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَـنِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ - إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ الشَّيْطَـنُ أَن يُوقِعَ بَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةَ وَالْبَغْضَآءَ فِى الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ وَيَصُدَّكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَعَنِ الصَّلَوةِ فَهَلْ أَنْتُمْ مُّنتَهُونَ ]

</p><p>[يَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَيْسِرِ قُلْ فِيهِمَآ إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ]
</p><p><i>(They ask you about Khamr and gambling. Say: &quot;In them there is great sin.&quot;) (2:219)</i>
</p>
Then, the Ayah in Surat An-Nisa' was revealed (on this subject) and then the Ayah in Surat Al-Ma'idah which prohibited Khamr.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=2&tid=5762?sid=2&tid=5762">The Gradual Prohibition of Khamr (Alchoholic Drink)</a><br>Tafsir ibn Kathir</div></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Al_Jalalayn">Al Jalalayn</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">They ask you about wine, and divinatory arrows, gambling, and what the ruling is regarding them. Say, to them: ‘In both, that is, in the partaking of both, is great sin (a variant reading [for kabīr, ‘great’] has kathīr, ‘much’) because of the fighting, cursing and swearing that ensue from it; and profit for men, by way of delight and enjoyment in wine, and acquiring money effortlessly from gambling; but the sin in them, that is, the degenerate behaviour in which they result, is greater, graver, than the usefulness’. When this verse was revealed, some gave up drinking, while others persisted, until the verse of sūrat al-Mā’ida [Q. 5:90-91] finally made it illicit. And they will ask you what, that is to say, how much, they should expend. Say, expend, ‘Comfortably’ (al-‘afwa [in the accusative] is also read in the nominative, al-‘afwu, implying a preceding huwa), that is, the surplus of your need, and do not expend what you need, ruining yourselves. So, just as He explained to you what has been mentioned, God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect,<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=2&tAyahNo=219&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=74&tSoraNo=2&tAyahNo=219&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2">Surah 2 Ayah 219</a><br>Tafsir al-Jalalayn, trans.

<div class="quotes">O you who believe, verily wine, that intoxicates and overcomes the mind, and games of chance, gambling, and idols, and divinatory arrows are an abomination, an evil deemed vile, of Satan’s work, which he adorns; so avoid it, this abomination consisting of the things mentioned, do not do it; so that you might prosper.<br><br>Satan desires only to precipitate enmity and hatred between you through wine and games of chance, when you partake of them, because of the evil and discord that result therefrom; and to bar you, by your being preoccupied with them, from the remembrance of God and from prayer — He has specifically mentioned it [prayer] so as to magnify it.

<div class="quotes">(They question thee about strong drink and games of chance). This was revealed about 'Umar Ibn al-Khattab who prayed: “O Allah! Show us Your judgement regarding alcoholic drinks!” So Allah said to Muhammad (pbuh): (Say) O Muhammad! (in both is great sin) this is after they were declared unlawful, (and (some) utility for men) by means of their trading, i.e. before they were unlawful; (but the sin of them) after their being declared unlawful (is greater than their usefulness) before they were made unlawful; and then both were prohibited. (And they ask thee what they ought to spend). This was revealed about 'Amr Ibn al-Jamuh who asked the Prophet (pbuh): “What should we spend from our wealth”. Allah told His Prophet: they ask you about what they should spend from their wealth. (Say: That which is superfluous) that which is in surplus to your sustenance requirements and of food for your dependents. But this was abrogated by those verses on the poor-due. (Thus Allah maketh plain to you (the) revelations) the commands and prohibitions and the insignificance of this world, (that ye may reflect) that it is evanescent.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=5&tAyahNo=91&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=73&tSoraNo=5&tAyahNo=91&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2">Surah 2 Ayah 219</a><br>Tafsir Ibn 'Abbas, trans.

(Satan seeketh only to cast among you enmity and hatred by means of strong drink) when you become drunk (and games of chance) when you loose your money, (and to turn you from remembrance of Allah) He says: intoxicants drive you from the obedience of Allah (and from (His) worship) He says: it also prevents you from performing the five daily prayers.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Al_Wahidi">Al Wahidi</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">(O ye who believe! Strong drink and games of chance and idols and divining arrows are only an infamy of Satan’s handiwork) [5:90]. Abu Sa‘id ibn Abi Bakr al-Mutawwi’i informed us&gt; Abu ‘Amr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Hiri&gt; Ahmad ibn ‘Ali al-Mawsili&gt; Abu Khaythamah&gt; al-Hasan ibn Musa&gt; Zuhayr&gt; Simak ibn Harb&gt; Mus‘ab ibn Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas&gt; his father who said: “I went to a group of Emigrants and Helpers and they said to me: ‘Let us feed you and give you wine to drink’, this was before intoxicants were made unlawful. So I went to a field where they had a roasted camel's head and a barrel of wine. I ate and drank with them. Then I mentioned the Emigrants and the Helpers and said: ‘The Emigrants are better than the Helpers’. One of the man grabbed one of the jawbones [of the head we ate] and hit me with it, severing my nose in the process. I went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and informed him of what had happened, and Allah, exalted is He, revealed about me the matter of intoxicants (drink and games of chance)”. Narrated by Muslim from Abu Khaythamah. 
<p>‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Hamdan al-‘Adl informed us&gt; Ahmad ibn Ja‘far ibn Malik&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal&gt; his father&gt; Khalaf ibn al-Walid&gt; Isra’il&gt; Abu Ishaq&gt; Abu Maysarah&gt; ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab who made a supplication, saying: “O Allah, explain to us unequivocally the matter of intoxicants”, and so the verse of Surah al-Baqarah was revealed (They question thee about strong drink and games of chance) [2:219] ‘Umar was summoned and this verse was recited to him. But he prayed again: “O Allah, explain to us unequivocally the matter of intoxicants”, and so the verse of Surah al-Nisa’ was revealed (O ye who believe! Draw not near unto prayer when ye are drunken…). The crier of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to say after announcing the beginning of any prayer: “Whoever is drunk should not approach the prayer”. Again ‘Umar was summoned and this verse was recited to him. Again he prayed: “O Allah, explain to us unequivocally the matter of intoxicants”. This verse was then revealed (Strong drink and games of chance). ‘Umar was summoned and the verse was recited to him and when it got to the words of Allah (Will ye then have done?), upon which ‘Umar said: “We refrain from it, we refrain from it”. There were things that happened due to the consumption of intoxicants, before they were made lawful, which the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, disliked. Of these is the story of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hamzah, may Allah be well pleased with them. 
</p>
Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us&gt; Abu Bakr ibn Abi Khalid&gt; Yusuf ibn Musa al-Marwazi&gt; Ahmad ibn Salih&gt; ‘Anbasah&gt; Yusuf&gt; Ibn Shihab&gt; ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn&gt; Husayn ibn ‘Ali who related that ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib said: “I had an old camel mare which was my share from the booty of Badr. Before that, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, had given me an old camel mare from the quint (khums). And when I was going to marry Fatimah, I had an appointment with a goldsmith from Banu Qaynuqa‘ whom I wanted to travel with me to buy Bulrush (Idhkhir) from a goldsmith for my wedding ceremony. I went to gather some saddles, sacks and ropes — for my camels which were kneeled down close to a Helper’s room. When I came back, I found my two camels with their humps cut off, their haunches ripped open and their insides taken away. I could not believe what I saw, and asked: ‘Who did this?’ They said: ‘It was Hamzah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib; he is now in the house drinking with some Helpers. They have a songstress who had sung: O Hamzah, proceed to the old fat camels Which are tied in the courtyard. Put the knife to their throat And, O Hamzah, smear blood on them. And feed us from their slices, meat on skewer attached together on glowing fire. For you are, O Abu ‘Umarah, our hope To relieve us from harm and affliction. So when he heard this, he jumped to his sword, cut off the camels’ humps, ripped open their haunches and took away their insides’. I proceeded until I entered in on the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. He had with him Zayd ibn Harithah. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, knew why I went to see him. He said: ‘What’s the matter with you?’ I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have not seen anything like what I saw today. Hamzah attacked my camels, cut off their humps, ripped open their haunches and he is still drinking until now in a certain house’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called for his outer garment and walked off. Zayd ibn Harithah and I followed him. He proceeded until he arrived to the house where Hamzah was drinking. He asked permission to enter and permission was granted. They were all drunk. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, began reproaching Hamzah for what he did while Hamzah’s eyes were red from being completely drunk. Hamzah looked at the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace; then he stared at him, looked at his knees, then stared at his face and said: ‘Are you not but the slaves of my father?’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, realised that he was very drunk. He stepped back, left the house and we left after him”. Narrated by Bukhari from Ahmad ibn Salih. This incident was among the reasons which made incumbent the revelation of forbidding intoxicants.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=86&tSoraNo=5&tAyahNo=90&tDisplay=yes&Page=3&Size=1&LanguageId=2?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=86&tSoraNo=5&tAyahNo=90&tDisplay=yes&Page=3&Size=1&LanguageId=2">Surah 5 Ayah 90</a><br>Asbab Al-Nuzul by Al-Wahidi , trans.
