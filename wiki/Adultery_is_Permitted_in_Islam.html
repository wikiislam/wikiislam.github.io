<div class="quotes"><i>Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess.</i> The Ayah means, you are prohibited from marrying women who are already married, <i>except those whom your right hands possess</i>, except those whom you acquire through war, for you are allowed such women after making sure they are not pregnant. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &quot;We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah was revealed, <i>Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess</i>. Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.&quot; This is the wording collected by At-Tirmidhi An-Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir and Muslim in his Sahih.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=4&tid=10797?sid=4&tid=10797">The Prohibition of Taking Two Sisters as Rival Wives (Qur'an 4:24)</a><br>Tafsir Ibn Kathir</div></div>

<div class="quotes"><i>And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess…</i> [4:24]. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Bunani informed us through Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri who said: “We had captured female prisoners of war on the day of Awtas and because they were already married we disliked having any physical relationship with them. Then we asked the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, about them. And the verse, <i>And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess</i>, was then revealed, <b>as a result of which we consider it lawful to have a physical relationship with them”.</b> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Harith informed us through ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja‘far through Abu Yahya through Sahl ibn ‘Uthman through ‘Abd al-Rahim through Ash‘ath ibn Sawwar through ‘Uthman al-Batti through Abu’l-Khalil through Abu Sa‘id who said: “When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, captured the people of Awtas as prisoners of war we said: ‘O Prophet of Allah! How can we possibly have physical relationships with women whose lineage and husband we know very well?’ And so this verse was revealed: <i>And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess</i>”. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us through Muhammad ibn ‘Isa ibn ‘Amrawayh through Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Sufyan through Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj through ‘Ubayd Allah ibn ‘Umar al-Qawariri through Yazid ibn Zuray‘through Sa‘id ibn Abi ‘Arubah through Qatadah through Abu Salih Abu Khalil through Abu ‘Alqamah al-Hashimi through Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri who reported that on the day of Hunayn the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent an army to Awtas. This army met the enemy in a battle, defeated them and captured many female prisoners from them. But some of the Companions of the Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, were uncomfortable about having physical relations with these prisoners because they had husbands who were idolaters, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about this: <i>And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess</i>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=86&tSoraNo=4&tAyahNo=24&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=86&tSoraNo=4&tAyahNo=24&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=2">Qur'an 4:24</a><br>Tafsir al-Wahidi</div></div>

<div class="quotes">That is, those women who become prisoners of war, while their unbelieving husbands are left behind in the War Zone, are not unlawful because their marriage ties are broken by the fact that they have come from the War Zone into the Islamic Zone. It is lawful to marry such women, and it is also lawful for those, in whose possession they are, to have sexual relations with them. There is, however, a difference of opinion as to whether such a woman is lawful, if her husband is also taken a prisoner along with her. Imam Abu Hanifah and those of his way of thinking are of the opinion that the marriage tie of such a pair would remain intact but Imam Malik and Shafi 'i, are of the opinion that it would also break.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=4&verse=23&to=25?sura=4&verse=23&to=25">Qur'an 4:24</a><br>Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, Tafhim al-Qur'an</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Abu Sai’d al-Khudri said : The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers. So Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur’anic verse: (Sura 4:24) &quot;And all married women (are forbidden) unto you except those captives whom your right hands possess.&quot; That is to say, captive women are lawful for them when they complete their menstrual period.

<div class="quotes"> After the distribution of the spoils of war a man may have intercourse with the female slave after passing one menstrual period, if she is not pregnant. If she is pregnant one should wait till she delivers the child. This is the view held by Malik, al-Shafi’i and Abu Thawr. Abu Hanifah holds that if both the husband and wife are captivated together, their marriage tie still continues; they will not be separated. According to the majority of scholars, they will be separated. Al-Awza-i maintains that their marriage tie will continue till they remain part of the spoils of war. If a man buys them, he may separate them if he desires, and cohabit with the female slave after one menstrual period.

<div class="quotes">It may, superficially, appear distasteful to copulate with a woman who is not a man's legal wife, but once Shariat makes something lawful, we have to accept it as lawful, whether it appeals to our taste, or not; and whether we know its underlying wisdom or not. It is necessary for a Muslim to be acquainted with the laws of Shariat, but it is not necessary for him to delve into each law in order to find the underlying wisdom of these laws because knowledge of the wisdom of some of the laws may be beyond his puny comprehension. Allah Ta'ala has said in the Holy Quran: ?Wa maa ooteetum min al-ilm illaa qaleelan? which means, more or less, that, &quot;You have been given a very small portion of knowledge?. Hence, if a person fails to comprehend the underlying wisdom of any law of Shariat, he cannot regard it as a fault of Shariat (Allah forbid), on the contrary, it is the fault of his own perception and lack of understanding, because no law of Shariat is contradictory to wisdom. 
<p>Nevertheless, the wisdom underlying the permission granted by Shariat to copulate with a slave woman is as follows: The LEGAL possession that a Muslim receives over a slave woman from the ?Ameerul-Mu'mineen? (the Islamic Head of State) gives him legal credence to have coition with the slave woman in his possession, just as the marriage ceremony gives him legal credence to have coition with his wife. In other words, this LEGAL POSSESSION is, in effect, a SUBSTITUTE of the MARRIAGE CEREMONY. A free woman cannot be 'possessed', bought or sold like other possessions; therefore Shariat instituted a 'marriage ceremony' in which affirmation and consent takes place, which gives a man the right to copulate with her. On the other hand, a slave girl can be possessed and even bought and sold, thus, this right of possession, substituting as a marriage ceremony, entitles the owner to copulate with her. A similar example can be found in the slaughtering of animals; that after a formal slaughtering process, in which the words, ?Bismillahi Allahu Akbar? are recited, goats, cows, etc.; become ?Halaal? and lawful for consumption, whereas fish becomes ?Halaal? merely through 'possession' which substitutes for the slaughtering. 
</p>
In other words, just as legal possession of a fish that has been fished out of the water, makes it Halaal for human consumption without the initiation of a formal slaughtering process; similarly legal possession of a slave woman made her Halaal for the purpose of coition with her owner without the initiation of a formal marriage ceremony.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islam.tc/cgi-bin/askimam/ask.pl?q=14421&act=view?q=14421&act=view">What is a slave girls in islam?</a><br>MI.

A bondmaid taken by her master for sexual intercourse is called 'Suriyyah' (bondmaid taken as a makeshift for wife in terms of coitus).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?lang=E&Id=86251&Option=FatwaId?lang=E&Id=86251&Option=FatwaId">&quot; 'Azal can not prevent pregnancy&quot;</a><br>Islam Web Fatwa No. 86251, September 17, 2003</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Allaah has permitted intimacy with a slave woman if the man owns her. This is not regarded as adultery as suggested in the question. Allaah says, describing the believers (interpretation of the meaning): 
<p>“those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
</p><p>Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess,__ for then, they are free from blame”
</p><p>[al-Mu’minoon 23:5] 
</p><p>What is meant by “those whom their right hands possess” is slave women or concubines.  See also question no. 10382, 12562. 
</p>
Once this is understood, it should be noted that what is suggested in the question, that this was zina, never occurred to the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). What they were asking about was the ruling on practicing ‘azl with the slave women whom they had acquired in the course of jihad. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/20802/Azl">Intercourse with a slave woman is not regarded as zina (adultery)</a><br>Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 20802</div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Muslim men are not required to have a <a href="wiki/Nikah.html" title="Nikah" class="mw-redirect">contract</a> with their slave girls as they would with legal wives and concubine-wives.  The man may sell his slave girl as long as she is not pregnant with his child.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adultery_is_Permitted_in_Islam.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>  Her freedom is not guaranteed unless she bears her master's child <i>and</i> out-lives him.  He may not force her into prostitution<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adultery_is_Permitted_in_Islam.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>; however, he is not obligated to keep her in his household.  He may sell her to another man who is then permitted to have sexual relations with her because she is his <i>right hand possession</i>.  He may also give his female slave in marriage to another man, but at that point the original owner is no longer permitted to have sexual relations with the woman.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Adultery_is_Permitted_in_Islam.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
