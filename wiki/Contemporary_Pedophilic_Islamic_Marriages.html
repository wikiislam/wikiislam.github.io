<p><b>Afghanistan</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">In Afghanistan, despite the law against child brides, <b>more than half of all girls are married before they turn 15</b>, usually to settle disputes.<br>. . .<br>
<p>A Unicef study from 2000 to 2008 found that more than 43 per cent of women in Afghanistan were married under age, some before puberty. 
</p>
In 2009 Human Rights Watch and Unifem, a UN agency, classified 57 per cent of all brides as under age, which is below 16. Despite the changes in the state law, not much seems to have changed since then<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Azerbaijan</b>
</p><p>93% of <a href="wiki/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>'s population identify as Muslim.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Officials in Azerbaijan are so concerned by the number of women getting married under-age that parliament is discussing raising the minimum age for marriage to 18.
<p>Women’s rights activists say corrupt religious officials are prepared to conduct Islamic ceremonies for couples when the woman is too young for a state service, leaving her unprotected if her husband leaves her, uneducated and vulnerable to medical complications.<br>. . .<br>
</p><p>In Khachmaz, a city near Azerbaijan’s border with Russia, <b>of 2,500 pupils in their final year of school, almost 130 girls were not attending since they had already married.</b> The headmaster, she said, took no action, although education is compulsory.
</p>
But her organisation’s research shows that the problem of young marriages is most pronounced in the southern regions bordering Iran.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Bangladesh</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">According to statistics from 2005, 45% of women then between 25 and 29 were married by the age of 15 in Bangladesh. According to the “State of the World’s Children-2009” report, 63% of all women aged 20–24 were married before the age of 18.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Canada</b>
</p><p>According to an article in the <i>Toronto Sun</i>, Muslim child brides in <a href="wiki/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> are on the rise:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Federal immigration officials say there’s little they can do to stop “child brides” from being sponsored into Canada by much older husbands who wed them in arranged marriages abroad.
<p>Top immigration officials in Canada and Pakistan say all they can do is reject the sponsorships of husbands trying to bring their child-brides to Canada. The men have to reapply when the bride turns 16. The marriages are permitted under Sharia Law.
</p><p>Muslim men, who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents return to their homeland to wed a “child bride” in an arranged marriage in which a dowry is given to the girl’s parents. Officials said some of the brides can be 14 years old or younger and are “forced” to marry. The practice occurs in a host of countries including: Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Lebanon. 
</p><p>Not valid in Canada
</p><p>Canadian visa officer Steve Bulmer said in classified documents he refused to allow one Pakistani man to sponsor his 15-year-old bride in August 2009.
</p><p>“I can find no section (of law) that states the marriage is ‘invalid’ or ‘void,” Bulmer wrote in e-mails obtained by lawyer Richard Kurland under Access of Information. “I am afraid the age does not invalidate the marriage even if it is illegal to marry.”
</p><p>Abdul Hameed, of the Canadian embassy in Islamabad, said child marriages are not valid in Canada.
</p><p>“A child marriage is punishable but it does not render the marriage invalid,” Hameed said. “We are refusing such application on grounds the marriage will not be valid as per Canadian laws.”
</p><p>William Hawke, of immigration’s Permanent Resident Unit, said the young brides won’t be allowed in Canada.
</p>
“Sponsorship applications submitted for a spouse under 16 will be refused,” he said.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Germany</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">More than 3,000 women and girls in Germany, most <b>from Muslim families</b> and many of them minors, faced forced marriage in the course of a year, official research released this week indicates.
<p>The first federal study of its kind found <b>3,443 recorded cases in 2008</b> - the most recent year with sufficient data - in which people living in Germany were forced to wed or threatened with a forced marriage.
</p><p>Most were between the ages of 18 and 21, although <b>nearly a third of them were under the age of 17</b>.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
More than half were beaten or otherwise physically abused to convince them to marry, while more than one in four were threatened with weapons or told they would be killed if they did not go through with the marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-AFP_November_12.2C_2011_11-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-AFP_November_12.2C_2011-11">[11]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Malaysia</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Data in the 2010 progress report to the United Nations on HIV in Malaysia prepared by the Ministry of Health reveals shocking statistics on the number of Muslim girls under the age of 14 who have undergone pre-marital HIV screening in order to get married.
<p>The data shows that 32 girls under the age of 10 and 445 girls between the ages of 10 and 14 went through this testing in 2009 alone in preparation for marriage!
</p>
What is also significant is that this phenomenon is taking place in the more developed states in Malaysia, with the highest numbers recorded in Penang (195), Malacca (103) and Johor (87).<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><br> </div>
<div class="quotes"><b>There was an increase in marriages involving underage Muslims in the Federal Territory last year</b>. 
<p>This goes against the assumption that child marriages are now on the decline due to changing cultural trends.
</p><p>Last year [2009], 49 Muslim girls under 16 years of age and 39 boys under 18 tied the knot.
</p><p>According to the statistics provided by the Federal Territory Religious Department, this number was higher compared with the previous year.<br>. . .<br>
</p><p>In 2008, 40 girls and 28 boys below the permitted age registered their marriages.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
<b>It was also reported last week that, according to the 2000 Census, there were 11,400 children below 15 years of age who were married -- 6,800 girls and 4,600 boys.</b><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Morocco</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">The legal minimum age for marriage in Morocco is 18 years, although family judges are empowered to allow exceptions. This loophole has enabled thousands of families to marry off their daughters prematurely.<br><br>
According to figures from the justice ministry, over 31,000 under-age girls were married in 2008, compared with 29,847 in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Nigeria</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Northern Nigeria has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world: nearly half of all girls here are married by the age of 15.
<p>The consequences have been devastating. Nigeria has the highest maternal mortality rate in Africa and one of the world’s highest rates of fistula, a condition that can occur when the pressure of childbirth tears a hole between the vagina and the bladder or rectum. Many women are left incontinent for life. Up to 800,000 women suffer from fistula in Nigeria.<br>. . .<br>
Dr Waaldijk operates on up to 600 women a year, with no electricity or running water... Some have been divorced by their husbands - it is estimated that up to half of adolescent girls in northern Nigeria are divorced... The Nigerian federal Government has attempted to outlaw child marriage. In 2003 it passed the Child Rights Act, prohibiting marriage under the age of 18. In the Muslim northern states, though, there has been fierce resistance to the Act, with many people portraying it as antiIslamic.<br>. . .<br>
Half of Nigeria’s 36 states have passed the Act, but it has been adopted by only one of the dozen Muslim states - and even that one made a crucial amendment substituting the age of 18 for the term “puberty”.
</p>
Each state in Nigeria has the constitutional right to amend legislation to comply with its local traditions and religion, meaning that central government is powerless to impose a minimum age of marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-TONOV282008_15-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-TONOV282008-15">[15]</a></sup><br> </div>
<p><b>Palestinian Authority area</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">According the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 682 girls aged 14 and younger were legally married in 2000. Two of them were married to men who were 35 or older, 13 to men 30 to 34, 117 to men 25 to 29, 378 to men 20 to 24 and 172 to men 15 to 19. Child marriages of girls 14 and younger made up 2.9 per cent of the total number of registered marriages. In the same year, 13,163 Palestinian girls between 15 and 19 were legally married, surpassing 55 per cent of all registered marriages.<br><br>
Local human rights organizations are deeply concerned about child marriage in Palestinian society. Participants of a conference in Gaza dedicated to this issue in January 2008, organized by the Palestinian Medical Relief Society (PMRS), warned of the “significant rise in child marriage rate” and its severe psychological and physical implications on the youth.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><br> </div>

<p><b>Yemen</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Yemeni parliament had actually approved a law last year that set a minimum marriageable age of 17 for boys and 18 for girls.  (Significantly, the family of Elham Mahdi al Assi lied that she was 18 years old).  According to the UN statistics, <b>more than half of Yemeni girls got married before reaching puberty</b>. That means more than half of all marriages in Yemen are child marriages. In line with the UN statistics, the Gender Development Research and Studies Centre at Sana’a University carried out a study on early marriage in 2008  and  found that <b>52.1 per cent of girls are under 18 when they wed, compared with 6.7 per cent of boys</b>.<br><br>

<div class="quotes">Getting married at an early age is something that is confirmed by the book of Allah, the Sunnah of his Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam), the consensus of the scholars and the actions of the companions, and the Muslims who came after them... 
<p>There are many Ahadith which confirm that marriage at an early age was widespread among the companions and no one denied its permissibility. Getting married at an early age was not peculiar to the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) as some people think, but it was general for him and for his Ummah.
</p><p>The following are some of the actions of the Sahaba (companions):
</p><p>1. Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with him, married his daughter, Um Kulthum to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased with him, and she mothered a child before the death of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam). Omar got married to her while she was young before reaching the age of puberty. This is reported by Ibn Saad in 'Al-Tabaqat'.
</p><p>2. From Urwa Ibn Zubair: that Zubair, may Allah be pleased with him, married his daughter when she was very young. Reported by Saeed Ibn Mansour, in his Sunnah, and Ibn Abi Shaibah, in Al-musannaf, with a Sahih chain of narration.
</p><p>Al-Shafie said in the book of Al-Um: &quot;Many companions of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) married their daughters while these were still young.&quot;
</p><p>Delaying the marriage of girls in many Muslim countries is something new and contradictory to what Muslims used to do over many centuries. This is because of westernization and the application of man-made laws. This caused a change in understandings and customs within a considerable number of the population, and it is absolutely not permissible to consider the customs and traditions in a given country as the standard by which people abide, and fail to obey the absolute evidences of Shariah.
</p><p>In some Muslim countries, the marriage for girls has been delayed by many years beyond the age of puberty. This has indeed led to an increase in the removal of the veil from the face, and increased fornication and adultery, as well as the emergence of deviation in conduct and religion among the youth. They had become morally unstable as they lack affection, chastity, and protection their private parts from illegal sexual relations.
</p>
By delaying marriage, there is also a reduction in the number of Muslims in the Ummah, and this is contrary to the order of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam), as he ordered us to have many children so that the Muslim nation will be greater in number than the previous nations.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/Fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?Option=FatwaId&lang=E&Id=88089?Option=FatwaId&lang=E&Id=88089">Child marriage in Islam</a><br>Islamweb, Fatwa No. 88089, June 24, 2004</div></div>

<p>In September 2009, a 12-year-old Yemeni girl who was forced into marriage died during a painful childbirth which also killed her baby.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>  In 2008, 10-year-old Nujood Ali went to a courthouse by herself, after attempts to get help from relatives failed, and demanded a divorce, generating a landmark legal case.  The judge granted the girl a permanent divorce from her 30-year-old husband who had raped and beaten Nujood on their wedding night.  Her lawyer said that they were &quot;lucky with this judge.  Another judge might not have accepted her in court, and would have asked her father or brother to come instead.&quot;  Had that happened, Nujood would probably still be married.  However, based on the principles of <a href="wiki/Islamic_law.html" title="Islamic law" class="mw-redirect">Shariah law</a>, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted. Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day.  She also feels like an outcast among her relatives and friends.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>  Just weeks after Nujood's case, 9-year-old Arwa Abdu Muhammad Ali ran away from her 35-year-old husband to a local hospital and reported that she had been beaten and sexually abused for eight months.  The judge who heard her case briefly jailed the local judge who had approved the marriage contract.  Arwa's husband refused to show up to court.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>  Also in 2008, Reem, a Yemeni girl married at 12, sought a divorce from her 30-year-old husband after he choked her, bit her, dragged her by the hair, and raped her when she resisted his demands for sex.  He imprisoned her in his house for 11 days during which time she tried to kill herself with a kitchen knife before being rescued by her mother.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>  Her father had forced her into the marriage with her cousin, resorting to a gag and tying her up twice.  He also threatened to kill the girl for defying him.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>In countries like Yemen, Bangladesh, Iran, and Northern Nigeria, attempts at reforming laws and banning child marriages have been opposed and stopped on the grounds that such a ban would be un-Islamic,<sup id="cite_ref-TONOV282008_15-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-TONOV282008-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-TNTJuly212013_32-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-TNTJuly212013-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weekly_Blitz_38-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-Weekly_Blitz-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MESSAGE_22-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-MESSAGE-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IRIN_21-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-IRIN-21">[21]</a></sup> and in the case of Malaysia, the growing Muslim population has effectively turned back the clock on social progress by passing new laws which allow for the practice of pedophilic marriages specifically between followers of Islam.<sup id="cite_ref-World_News_Australia_43-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Contemporary_Pedophilic_Islamic_Marriages.html#cite_note-World_News_Australia-43">[43]</a></sup> So one has to agree that whatever reasons and justification people may give for the prevalence of child marriages in Muslim-majority nations, without Islam this practice would have long been discarded as immoral and unacceptable in the modern world.
