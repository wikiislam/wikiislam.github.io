<p>Prophet <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad's</a> declared that the majority of the inhabitants of <a href="wiki/Hell.html" title="Hell">Hell</a> are women.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_are_Deficient_in_Intelligence.html#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> When asked why, he said it was because they are deficient in intelligence and religion, and because they are ungrateful to their husbands. Although <a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">apologists</a> and female Muslims use a lot of creative arguments to explain away Muhammad's declarations about women, they do not stand up to scrutiny. Here we will present evidence showing Muhammad's belief that <i>all</i> women are less intelligent than their male counterparts; as well as examine and refute the common Muslim claims about the <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">ahadith</a> in question.

On 'Id ul Fitr or 'Id ul Adha Allah's Apostle (p.b.u.h) went out to the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered the people to give alms. He said, &quot;O people! Give alms.&quot; Then he went towards the women and said. &quot;O women!

Then she said, &quot;O Prophet of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody else.&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;Ibn Masud had spoken the truth.

<div class="quotes">
<p><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> O ye who believe! When ye deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time, reduce them to writing Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuse to write: as Allah Has taught him, so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate, but let him fear His Lord Allah, and not diminish aught of what he owes. If they party liable is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable Himself to dictate, Let his guardian dictate faithfully, and get two witnesses, out of your own men, <b>and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her.</b> The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (For evidence). Disdain not to reduce to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of Allah, More suitable as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witness whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So fear Allah; For it is Good that teaches you. And Allah is well acquainted with all things. If ye are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust, and let him Fear his Lord conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it, - his heart is tainted with sin. And Allah knoweth all that ye do.
</p><p><br>
<b>Pickthal:</b> O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in (terms of) equity. No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of his interests dictate in (terms of) equity. And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. <b>And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness) the other will remember.</b> And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah and more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witnesses when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do (harm to them) lo! it is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of all things.
</p><p><br>
</p>
<b>Shakir:</b> O you who believe! when you deal with each other in contracting a debt for a fixed time, then write it down; and let a scribe write it down between you with fairness; and the scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so he should write; and let him who owes the debt dictate, and he should be careful of (his duty to) Allah, his Lord, and not diminish anything from it; but if he who owes the debt is unsound in understanding, or weak, or (if) he is not able to dictate himself, let his guardian dictate with fairness; and call in to witness from among your men two witnesses; <b>but if there are not two men, then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to be witnesses, so that if one of the two errs, the second of the two may remind the other</b>; and the witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned; and be not averse to writing it (whether it is) small or large, with the time of its falling due; this is more equitable in the sight of Allah and assures greater accuracy in testimony, and the nearest (way) that you may not entertain doubts (afterwards), except when it is ready merchandise which you give and take among yourselves from hand to hand, then there is no blame on you in not writing it down; and have witnesses when you barter with one another, and let no harm be done to the scribe or to the witness; and if you do (it) then surely it will be a transgression in you, and be careful of (your duty) to Allah, Allah teaches you, and Allah knows all things<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.282#002.282">2:282</a></div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Apologetic_Claims">Apologetic Claims</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_was_referring_to_that_specific_group_of_women_only">Muhammad was referring to that specific group of women only</span></h3>
<p>Here is a video from Rasha Al-Disuqi, a West Coast based professor, author, and activist.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_are_Deficient_in_Intelligence.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Her topic was &quot;Rights of Muslim women and their rights in society&quot;.
</p>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/GYoNDgB-jDU"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/GYoNDgB-jDU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></object>
</td></tr></table><br>
<p>In the above video she makes two claims:
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id=".22Not_a_blanket_statement_for_all_Women.22">&quot;Not a blanket statement for all Women&quot;</span></h4>
<div class="quotes"> That hadith was said at a specific time, during a specific situation, addressing a specific group and it was not meant to be as a blanket statement.<br> </div> 
<p>There is absolutely no evidence that Muhammad's statements in the ahadith were directed at that specific group of women because:
</p><p>1. Muhammad's sole piece of evidence for this statement is Allah's mandate in <i>Qur'an 2:282</i> which states that two women are required to give evidence in the absence of a man; this is to say that the testimony of one woman is equal to 1/2 of a man's testimony. Nowhere in that verse does it say &quot;This is for the women of Muhammad's time&quot; or &quot;this is only for a specific group of women.&quot; If the Qur'an is a book for all time, then the testimony of a woman is <i>always</i> the equivalent of 1/2 a man's testimony in Islam. Therefore, for Muhammad to use this as evidence as to the deficiency of a woman's mind <i>proves</i> that it was a &quot;blanket statement&quot; over all women who have and will ever live. 
</p><p>2. In the same hadith (not the partial one) Muhammad tells the women that they are also <i>deficient in religion</i>. Islam is very much a works-based religion; every day of fasting 'counts' for your reward in heaven, every prayer, every 'good deed' (as outlined in the Qur'an). Since women are not allowed to pray or fast during their menses, this means that a woman doing every 'good deed' she is able to do, and a man doing every 'good deed' they are able to, will result in the man receiving a higher reward from Allah because he was able to do more religious deeds than the female. 
</p><p>Do we also apply the &quot;This was only for that specific group of Women&quot; answer to Muhammad's claim that women are also deficient in religion? Are women suddenly allowed to fast and pray when they are menstruating? We know they aren't; so why should we apply one part of the hadith to that specific group of women when the second claim is clearly referring to all Muslim Women?
</p><p>3. Muhammad said &quot;The majority of the dwellers of Hellfire are Women.&quot; If these ahadith refer only to that group of women, then that group must have been extremely large. Think about how many women have and will exist on this earth throughout time. Now, the <i>majority</i> of the people in Hell are supposedly from this one group of Women that Muhammad was addressing? Where then are the pagans, the atheists, Christians, Jews and hypocritical Muslims? Where are the men? How <i>big</i> was this group of women?
</p><p>Muhammad was clearly making a blanket statement about <i>all</i> women.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Scans_of_male_and_female_brains_prove_it_was_only_for_that_group">Scans of male and female brains prove it was only for that group</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">Look at an X-RAY or MRI for that matter, you'll find that both [male and female] brains are the same; why should they be deficient in any way?
Women who are smarter, more intellectual in many fields. <b>THAT argument</b> [ that Muhammad was referring to all women ] <b>is a failure.</b><br> </div>
<p>This argument is illogical: <i>because</i> modern science has shown us that there is no 'deficiency' in a female brain, then Muhammad could not have been referring to every woman. This argument ignores the evidence in favor of a more palatable interpretation. The fact is, modern science and common sense prove Muhammad's statements to be incorrect. They do not prove that Muhammad was referring to a specific group of women only; merely that Muhammad was wrong in making a blanket statement. 
</p><p>Rasha then shoots herself in the foot by proving in one short sentence that Muhammad <i>was</i> wrong; she herself knows that women are not stupid; that they are equal to, or excel men in many fields. But, in order to remain under the influence of someone who called her 'deficient' , she must use current knowledge in order to 'spin' Muhammad's words. In essence, when she says &quot;That argument is a failure&quot; she is acknowledging that Muhammad was completely wrong to make such a claim.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_was_using_hyperbole_to_scare_women_into_giving_alms">Muhammad was using hyperbole to scare women into giving alms</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">But the Prophet (peace be upon him) was also being playful in his use of strong terms to impress this teaching on the listeners. Ruqayyah Waris Maqsud writes, “After the Farewell Pilgrimage at the Eid prayer, the Prophet walked past the men leaning on Bilal's arm, and came to the rows of women behind them. Bilal spread out a cloth and the Prophet urged the women to be generous with their gifts of charity, for when he had been allowed a glimpse into the flames of Hell, he had noted that most of the people being tormented there were women.
<p>The women were outraged, and one of them instantly stood up boldly and demanded to know why that was so.
'Because,' he replied, 'you women grumble so much, and show ingratitude to your husbands! Even if the poor fellows spent all their lives doing good things for you, you have only to be upset at the least thing and you will say, 'I have never received any good from you!' (Bukhari 1.28, recorded by Ibn Abbas - who was present on that occasion as a child).
</p>
At that the women began vigorously to pull off their rings and ear-rings, and throw them into Bilal's cloth.”<br> </div>
<p>This is a very disingenuous presentation of evidence. This interpretation attempts to draw together two different sets of ahadith and present them as the same event. The first set is provided above. Here are the ones for this specific interpretation:
</p>
<div class="quotes">
Ibn 'Abbas reported: I participated in the Fitr prayer with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman, and all of them observed this prayer before the Khutba, and then he (the Holy Prophet) delivered the sermon. Then the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) descended (from the pulpit) and I (perceive) as if I am seeing him as he is commanding people with his hand to sit down. He then made his way through their (assembly) till he came to the women. Bilal was with him. He then recited (this verse): O Prophet, when believing women come to thee giving thee a pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah&quot; (lx. 12) till he finished (his address to) them and then said: Do you conform to it (what has been described in the verse)? Only one woman among them replied: Yes, Apostle of Allah, but none else replied. He (the narrator) said: It could not be ascertained who actually she was. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted them to give alms. Bilal stretched his cloth and then said: Come forward with alms. Let my father and mother be taken as ransom for you. And they began to throw rings and ringlets in the cloth of Bilal.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/004-smt.php#004.1923#004.1923">4:1923</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">
Ibn 'Abbas reported: I bear testimony to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) offering prayer before Kutba. He (after saying prayer) delivered the Kutba, and he found that the women could not hear it, so he came to them and exhorted them and preached them and commanded them to give alms, and Bilal had stretched his cloth and the women were throwing rings, earrings and other things. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ayyub with the same chain of transmitters.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/004-smt.php#004.1924#004.1924">4:1924</a></div></div>
<div class="quotes">
Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: I observed prayer with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the 'Id day. He commenced with prayer before the sermon without Adhan and Iqama. He then stood up leaning on Bilal, and he commanded (them) to be on guard (against evil for the sake of) Allah, and he exhorted (them) on obedience to Him, and he preached to the people and admonished them. He then walked on till he came to the women and preached to them and admonished them, and asked them to give alms, for most of them are the fuel for Hell. A woman having a dark spot on the cheek stood up and said: Why is it so, Messenger of Allah? He said: For you grumble often and show ingratitude to your spouse. And then they began to give alms out of their ornaments such as their earrings and rings which they threw on to the cloth of Bilal.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/004-smt.php#004.1926#004.1926">4:1926</a></div></div>
<p>It is true that Muhammad approached the women after prayer in both sets of ahadith; and that he asked them to give alms. However we note in the second set, not even once, does Muhammad make the same claims about Women's intelligence or religion. He merely states that women are <i>ungrateful</i> in an effort to goad them into giving more charity. If these ahadith were narrations of the same event, you would expect a mention of intelligence or religion.
</p><p>Even if this explanation was right, it still doesn't explain why Muhammad called women deficient in intelligence, and then directed them to the mandate in Qur'an 2:282 as evidence for this deficiency. If his aim was simply to get them to donate more money, surely a threat of hellfire and calling them ungrateful would have sufficed for his purpose; and evidently it did.
</p><p>Muhammad also knew that Hellfire was a great motivator to his followers; once he found a threat that worked, he milked it for all it was worth. Because of the discrepancies between the two sets of narrations, we can conclude that the two  sets of narrations are from separate events; and that Muhammad simply re-used a scare tactic in order to get what he wanted. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deficiency_is_only_about_giving_financial_testimony">Deficiency is only about giving  financial testimony</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Muhammad did say women are deficient in Intelligence. However, since his evidence was Quran 2:282, Muhammad was only referring to the deficiency of women when giving testimony for financial transactions.<br> </div>
<p>Qur'an 2:282 states that the second female witness is required (in lieu of a man) because the first woman may forget; therefore the second can remind her. This implies that women have bad memories and are prone, more so then men, to forget details. On first look, this explanation looks quite reasonable; however in the ahadith, Muhammad did not specify that the testimony of women, <i>in financial cases only</i> was the cause of their intelligence defects. If this were truly only about testimony for financial cases, then Muhammad would have specified this. His statement &quot;Isn't it true that <i>the</i> testimony of two women is equal to that of a man&quot; strongly implies that two female witnesses are required for any type of testimony; and in no way implies that it is for financial testimony only. 
</p><p>After all, if <i>this</i> is the deficiency in her intelligence; then Muhammad is clearly referring to the fact that Allah believes that women have bad memories; and <i>this</i> is the reason a woman is deficient.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Muhammad_was_joking">Muhammad was joking</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Muhammad knew that group of women very well, and as he would pass by them he would joke around with them. When he said that they were deficient in Intelligence and Religion he was joking around. They understood this.<br> </div>
<p>This is one of the most bizarre claims we've come across regarding these ahadith. When asked for evidence, the claimant is unable to do so. In any case, there is absolutely no evidence in the ahadith or elsewhere that this was an 'in joke' between Muhammad and these women. 
</p><p>Muhammad also backs up these &quot;jokes&quot; with reference to the Qur'an, which he'd obviously take very seriously as the alleged prophet.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Al-Tabari.27s_Tarikh">Al-Tabari's Tarikh</span></h3>
<p>In the discussion thus far we have presented <a href="wiki/Sahih.html" title="Sahih">Sahih</a> ahadith attributed to Muhammad and have demonstrated each hadith was intended to be applied to all women for all time. We have seen Muslims attempt to explain away this assertion and argue that the ahadith applied only to certain women or particular situations, and did not apply to all women for all time. Which is the truth? What is the original source of Muhammad's view of women; where did it originate from?
</p><p>Abu Jafar Muhammad bin Jarir al-Tabari is recognized as one of the greatest of all Islamic scholars. He not only wrote one of the most authoritative Tafsir (commentary of the Qur'an) but also wrote a history of the world (tarikh) from the Islamic worldview. Published in English as <i>The History of al-Tabari</i> (SUNY Press, NY) in 39 volumes, this work presents world history from the creation account up until al-Tabari's death. When we consult al-Tabari's tarikh we find the source of Muhammad's view of women.
</p><p>When God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the garden, they were told to not eat of a certain tree. Eve was tempted by Iblis (Satan) to eat of the tree, and she then gave some to Adam to eat also. Adam and Eve try to flee from God because of shame after their private parts were exposed. From this act of disobedience of Eve came God's curse on women.
</p>
<div class="quotes">His Lord called out to him: Adam, is it from Me that you are fleeing? Adam replied: No, my Lord, but I feel shame before You. When God asked what had caused his trouble, he replied: Eve, My Lord. Whereupon God said: Now it is My obligation to make her bleed once every month, as she made this tree bleed. <b>I also must make her stupid, although I created her intelligent</b> <i>(halimah),</i> and must make her suffer pregnancy. Ibn Zayd continued: <b>Were it not for the affliction that affected Eve, the women of this world wound not menstruate, and they would be intelligent</b> and, when pregnant, give birth easily.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html" title="The History of al-Tabari">Al-Tabari, </a><a href="wiki/The_History_of_al-Tabari.html#Volume_I:_General_Introduction_and_From_the_Creation_to_the_Flood" title="The History of al-Tabari">Vol. 1, pp. 280-281</a></div></div>
<p>In a lecture delivered by Saudi cleric Abd Al-Aziz Al-Fawzan, which aired on Al-Majd TV (June 11, 2007),  he responds to the criticism made by 'enemies' of Islam against Muhammad's &quot;women are deficient&quot; statement by confirming the account found in Tabari:
</p>
<div class="quotes">The Prophet <b>Muhammad said about women: &quot;I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you</b>. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you,&quot; and so on. This hadith and others like it were misunderstood by the ignorant. Corrupt people interpreted it in a way that differs from its original intent. Because of their ignorance, their insolence, their stupidity, and because of their enmity towards Islam and Muslims, they turned this hadith into evidence that Islam disgraces women, diminishing her value, and describes her in inadequate terms.<br>. . .<br>
<p>These hadiths provide some of the most decisive evidence that Islam protects women and guarantees their rights. Islam has surrounded the woman with a fence of compassion and mercy. <b>It has shown that the twisted nature of women stems from their very creation. This is how Allah wanted woman to be.</b> Therefore, the husband must adapt himself to her and be patient with her. He should not giver her too many things to do, or things that she is incapable of doing. <b>He should not make her do anything that is contrary to her nature, and to the way she was created by Allah</b>. In addition, <b>he should turn a blind eye to her mistakes, he should tolerate her slips and errors, and put up with all the silly ignorant things she might say, because this constitutes part of the nature of her creation</b>. In addition, women have surging emotions, which in some cases, might overpower their minds. The weakness with which women were created is the secret behind their attractiveness and appeal to their husbands. It is the source of women's seduction of men, and one of the elements strengthening the bond between husband and wife. This is one of the wondrous miracles of Allah: The strength of a woman lies in her weakness. Her power of seduction and appeal lie in her emotions, which might overpower her mind at times.<br>. . .<br>
</p>
Both husband and wife should satisfy their spouse's natural urges, and should try to gratify their desires, as long as nothing prevents this. This is why the Prophet said: &quot;When a man calls his wife to fulfill his needs, she must go to him, even if she is busy with the oven.&quot; Imagine this: There is fire in the oven, and she wants to bake bread. But even if she's busy with this work that cannot be neglected, when he calls her, she must leave the oven and go to her husband. Another hadith says: &quot;She must go to him, even if she is on the back of a camel.&quot; She must go to him, even if she is riding.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.memri.org/clip/en/0/0/0/0/0/350/1483.htm">Husbands Should Put Up with Their Wives' Slips and Errors, Because the Twisted Nature of Women Stems from Their Very Creation</a><br>MEMRI TV, Clip No. 1483, Broadcast: June 11, 2007</div></div>

<div class="quotes"> 
<p><b>Yusuf Ali:</b> What! has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates, and granted to you sons for choice? When news is brought to one of them of (the birth of) what he sets up as a likeness to (Allah) Most Gracious, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief! <b>Is then one brought up among trinkets, and unable to give a clear account in a dispute (to be associated with Allah)?</b> And they make into females angels who themselves serve Allah.

<p>It should be noted that some modern Muslim scholars interpret 43:18 as a reference to female pagan idols or that Allah is still referring to the attitude of the pagans towards women.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Women_are_Deficient_in_Intelligence.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> However, the next verse (43:19) uses the same pattern - a statement of what the pagans believed followed by an interrogative alif (translated &quot;What!&quot;) and then Allah's rebuttal (&quot;did they witness their creation?&quot;). Thus it seems more likely that in 43:18 Allah is making what he thinks is a factual counter-argument rather than using what he believes is another false notion of the pagans to contradict their belief in daughters of Allah.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The meaning of these ahadith is very clear. Prophet Muhammad &quot;blanketed&quot; a statement over every single woman who has ever and will ever live. Despite many creative ways to explain away the meaning and implications of these ahadith, the actual evidence cannot be denied. Muhammad clearly said that women are deficient in intelligence because, in Islam, the value of their testimony is equal to that of half a man. If the Qur'an is a book for all people for all time, then that mandate stands; thus Muhammad was referring to all women in general; and not just a specific group of women. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Further_thoughts_on_these_ahadith">Further thoughts on these ahadith</span></h3>
<p>This set of ahadith clearly show Muhammad's hatred for women. He implemented every rule he could think of to keep them under the control of men and in a state of humiliation. Look at the three reasons that Muhammad lists for women being in Allah's Hell:
</p><p>1. Deficient in Intelligence: The Qur'an was 'revealed' by Muhammad on behalf of his imaginary deity, Allah; thus Muhammad himself made the requirement that the testimony of two women is equal to a man. He then goes on to tell women that they will most likely end up in hell; because their intellectual deficiency, which he defined and imposed 'safeguards' against. No evidence; just &quot;I said so!&quot; What better way to belittle women than to continually remind them that they are 'stupid'.
</p><p>2. Deficient in Religion: Again, Muhammad himself 'revealed' the entirety of Islam; its rules, regulations and requirements, rewards etc.. What better way to keep women down? Tell them your works-based religion, that they cannot perform any of these good works (praying, fasting etc..) when they are menstruating. This keeps them in a state of fear, because they have to make up for the days they were unable to be 'pious'; making them more submissive to Islam then men.  Then you get Muhammad who comes along, after making this silly rule about menstruation; and tells women that most of them will end up in hell because of it. In essence, he's saying that in <i>his</i> religion, women will end up in hell simply for being born female.
</p><p>3. Ungrateful to their Husbands: Again, Muhammad wanted his wives; and all Muslim women within his reach (in case he wanted to marry them) to be as submissive to their husbands as possible. He scares them with threats of hellfire to make them more submissive, and fearful of Allah; thereby keeping women under the thumb of their husbands. 
As a result, to this day, Muslim women, and women in general, are thought of by Muslims as intellectually inferior to themselves. Perhaps this is why Muslim women especially are trying to twist the meaning of these ahadith and narrow down the testimony requirement in Quran 2:282; its either that or admit Muhammad was wrong.
