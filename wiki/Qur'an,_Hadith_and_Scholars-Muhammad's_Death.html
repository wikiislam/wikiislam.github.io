Some said, &quot;What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask him ( to understand his state ).&quot; So they went to the Prophet and asked him again. The Prophet said, &quot;Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me for.&quot; Then he ordered them to do three things.

<div class="quotes">Narrated Aisha: It was one of the favors of Allah towards me that Allah's Apostle expired in my house on the day of my turn while he was leaning against my chest and Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva at his death. 'Abdur-Rahman entered upon me with a Siwak in his hand and I was supporting (the back of) Allah's Apostle (against my chest ). I saw the Prophet looking at it (i.e. Siwak) and I knew that he loved the Siwak, so I said ( to him ), &quot;Shall I take it for you ? &quot; He nodded in agreement. So I took it and it was too stiff for him to use, so I said, &quot;Shall I soften it for you ?&quot; He nodded his approval. So I softened it and he cleaned his teeth with it.

<div class="quotes"><b>The apostle of Allah and his companions ate from it.  It (goat) said:  &quot;I am poisoned.&quot;</b>  He [Muhammad] said to his Companions, &quot;Hold you hands!  because it has informed me that it is poisoned!&quot;  They withdrew their hands, but Bishr Ibn al-Bara expired.  The apostle of Allah sent for her (Jewess) and asked her, &quot;What induced you to do what you have done?&quot;  She replied, &quot;<b>I wanted to know if you are a prophet, in that case it will not harm you</b> and if you are a king, I shall relieve the people of you.  <b>He gave orders and she was put to death</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sa’d, Vol. 2, p. 249</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Verily <b>a woman of the Jews of Khaibar presented poisoned (meat of) goat to the apostle of Allah.  The he recognized that it was poisoned</b>, so he sent for her and asked her, &quot;What induced you to do what you have done?&quot;  She replied, &quot;I thought if you are a prophet, Allah will inform you, and if you are a pretender, I shall relieve people of you.  <b>When the apostle of Allah felt sick, he got himself &quot;cupped&quot;</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sa’d, Vol. 2, p. 250</div></div>
<div class="quotes">When the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, conquered Khaybar and he had peace of mind, Zaynab Bint al-Harith, the brother of Marhab, who was the spouse of Sallam Ibn Mishkam, inquired: Which part of the goat is liked by Muhammad? They said: The foreleg. Then she slaughtered one from her goats and roasted it (the meat). Then she wanted a poison which could not fail. The Jews discussed about poisons and became united on one poison.<b> She poisoned the she-goat putting more poison on the forelegs, and shoulder.</b> When the sun had set and the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, returned after leading the people in Maghrib (sun-set) prayers, she sat by his feet. He asked her about her. She said: O Abu al-Qasim! Here is a present which I wish to offer to you. The Prophet, may Allah bless him, ordered it to be taken. It was served to him and to his Companions who were present and among those who were present was Bishr Ibn al-Bara Ibn Ma’rur. Then the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said: Come closer and have night meal. <b>The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, took the foreleg, a piece of which he put into his mouth</b>. Bishr Ibn al-Bara took another bone and put it into his mouth. <b>When the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, ate one morsel of it</b> Bishr ate his and other people also ate from it. Then the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, said: Hold back your hands! Because this foreleg; and according to another version, the shoulder of the goat, has informed me that it is poisoned. Thereupon Bishr said: By Him Who hath made you great! I discovered it from the morsel I took. Nothing prevented me from emitting it out, but the idea that I did not like to make your food unrelishing. When you had eaten what was in your mouth, I did not like to save my life after yours, and I also thought you would not have eaten it if there was something wrong. Bishr did not rise from his seat but his color changed to that of taylsan (a green cloth). For a year the pain did not permit him to change his sides but with the help of others and then he expired. According to another version, he died before leaving his seat. He (Ibn Sa’d) said: A peace of it was dropped before a dog who ate it and died (instantaneously) without being able to move its foreleg. The Apostle of Allah sent for Zaynab Bint al-Harith and said to her: What induced you to do what you have done? She replied: <b>You have done to my people what you have done. You have killed my father, my uncle, and my husband, so I said to myself. If you are a prophet, the foreleg will inform you; and others have said: If you are a king we will get rid of you</b>. The Jewess returned as she had come. He (Ibn Sa’d) said: <b>The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, handed her over to the heirs of Bishr Ibn al-Bara who put her to death</b>.<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sa’d, Vol. 2, pp. 251-252</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, lived after this three years till in consequence of his pain he passed away</b>. During his illness he used to say: <b>I did not cease to find the effect of the (poisoned) morsel, I took at Khaybar and I suffered several times (from its effect) but now I feel the hour has come of the cutting of my jugular vein, which is a vein in the back</b><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sa’d, Vol. 2, p. 252</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Umm Bishr [the mother of the Muslim man who also died eating poison], came to the prophet during his illness and said, &quot;O apostle of Allah!  I never saw fever like it in any one.&quot;  The prophet said to her, &quot;Our trial is double and so our reward [in heaven], is double.  What do the people say about it [his illness]?&quot;  She said, &quot;They say it is pleurisy.&quot;  Thereupon the apostle said, &quot;Allah will not like to make His apostle suffer from it (pleurisy) because it indicates the possession of Satan,<b> but (my disease is the result of) the morsel that I had taken along your son</b>.

<div class="quotes"> When the last moment of the prophet was near, he used to draw a sheet over his face; but when he felt uneasy, he removed it from his face and said:  &quot;<b>Allah's damnation be on the Jews and the Christians</b> who made the graves of their prophets objects of worship.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref">Ibn Sa’d, Vol. 2, p. 322</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Al_Munajjid">Al Munajjid</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Then came the poisoning incident, after the conquest of Khaybar. Al-Bukhaari (2617) and Muslim (2190) narrated from Anas that a Jewish woman came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with some poisoned mutton. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate from it, then he asked her about that. She said, “I wanted to kill you.” He said, “Allaah would not let you do that.” They said, “Shall we kill her?” He said, “No.” He said, I can still see the effect of that on the palate of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
<p>Al-Nawawi said: It is as if the poison still left some trace of blackness etc. 
</p><p>The name of this woman was Zaynab bint al-Haarith, the wife of Salaam ibn Mashkam, one of the leaders of the Jews. 
</p><p>The reports differ as to whether or not she was killed. It seems that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not kill her at first, but when Bishr ibn al-Bara’ ibn Ma’roor died as a result of the effects of this food, <b>then he executed her as a qisaas punishment</b>.
</p><p>Al-Bukhaari (5777) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said:  When Khaybar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Let all the Jews who have been here, be assembled before me.” The Jews were gathered and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something?” They replied, “Yes.” He asked, “Have you poisoned this sheep?” They said, “Yes.” He asked, “What made you do that?” They said, “We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would have got rid of you, and if you are a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.” 
</p><p><b>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to feel ill because of this food, and he would be treated with cupping for that.</b> 
</p><p>Ahmad (2784) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a Jewish woman sent a gift to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of a poisoned roasted sheep. He sent for her and asked her, “What made you do what you did?” She said, “I wanted to see if you were a Prophet, then Allaah would tell you about it, and if you were not a Prophet the people would be rid of you.” Whenever the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) felt ill as a result of that he would have himself treated by cupping. On one occasion he traveled and when he entered ihraam he felt ill as a result of that and he had himself treated by cupping. The editor of al-Musnad classed it as saheeh. 
</p><p><b>That had an impact in causing his death, so he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died as a martyr (shaheed)</b>, as Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
</p><p>“If I were to swear by Allaah nine times that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was killed, that is more beloved to me than swearing once, because Allaah made him a Prophet and made him a martyr.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3617. The editors said, its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim. 
</p><p><b>Al-Sindi said: The words “he was killed” mean by the poison in the meat of the sheep’s foreleg that he ate, when the effects of that appeared when he was dying</b>. 
</p><p>Quoted from Haashiyat al-Musnad, 6/116. 
</p><p>Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh, in a mu’allaq report, and al-Haakim narrated in his Mustadrak in a mawsool report, that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, in the illness which would be his last, ‘O ‘Aa’ishah, I still feel the pain of the food that I ate in Khaybar, and this time I feel that my aorta is being cut from that poison.” 
</p>
The aorta is the vein that is towards the back and is connected to the heart; if it is cut then the person will die.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://islamqa.com/en/ref/32762&date=2011-11-05?url=http://islamqa.com/en/ref/32762&date=2011-11-05">The Jews’ attempts to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)</a><br>Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 32762</div></div>

<div class="quotes"><i>Question:</i>
<p>Some people doubt that the prophet may have died from poisoning. As a result of eating from the poisoned sheep that was offered to him by the Jewish woman, is this true?.
</p><p>Answer:
</p><p>Praise be to Allaah. 
</p><p><b>It is proven by the scholars who studied the Prophet’s biography in detail</b> that he ate mutton that had been poisoned by a Jewish woman in Khaybar, then the leg of mutton spoke and informed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that it was poisoned, so he stopped eating it. When his final illness came, he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O ‘Aa’ishah, I still feel the pain of the food that I ate in Khaybar, and this time I feel that my aorta is being cut from that poison.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh. <b>So there is no room for doubt that this poison affected his body, since it is proven in al-Saheeh and elsewhere</b>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="IslamWeb">IslamWeb</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; and may His blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions. Allah Said in His perfect Book: {<i>Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except Allah, knows what is hidden: nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment)</i>.}[27:65]. He the Almighty clearly Ordered His Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to inform the people: {<i>Say (O Muhammad (SAW) &quot;I don't tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the Unseen; …</i>}[6:50]. How can a common person, let alone a Muslim, believe that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) has the knowledge of the unseen while Allah and His Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) deny with that. In addition, having the knowledge of the unseen is among the special Attributes of Allah and He is deemed far above from sharing His Attributes with anyone else. In fact, during the time of the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam), He often used to informed some matters of the unseen such as the signs of the Last Hour, the wars that will happen, and he even informed about Paradise and Hell-fire, etc. But this was not based on his own knowledge rather Allah The Almighty informed him and ordered him to inform others. Allah Says (interpretation of meaning): {<i>&quot;(He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghaib (Unseen).</i>&quot; Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of unseen as much as He likes),… }[72:26]. 
<p><b>Claiming that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) is alive like us is a totally false claim</b>. The Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) died as other Prophets (Alaihim al-Salaam) died and he was buried in al-Madinah. Allah Says (interpretation of meaning): {<i>Muhammad is no more than a Messenger: many were the Messengers that passed away before him. If he died or were slain, will ye then turn back on your heels? If any did turn back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; but Allah (on the other hand) will swiftly reward those who (serve him) with gratitude.</i>}[3:144]. In another verse He Declares: {<i>Verily you (O Muhammad (SAW) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</i>}[39:30]. 
</p><p>Now the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) is in Barzakh, which is totally different from this world. The life in Barzakh is different from the life in this world. The details about the life of Barzakh could be known only by Qur'an and Sunnah since they are among the unseen matters. Allah Says (interpretation of meaning): {<i>…Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision.</i>}[3:169]. 
</p><p>In fact, the grade of Prophets (Alaihim Salaam) is far above the grade of martyrs, thus they are more entitled to be alive in the Barzakh. But the life and the matters of the Barzakh are not similar to the life and matters of this life. Allah Alone knows the details of that life. So comparing these two worlds is not possible. If the life of the Barzakh were similar to the life of this world, it would not be correct to ascribe death to the Prophet Salla Allahu Alaihi Wa Sallam, as mentioned in the above verse. 
</p><p><b>Due to the differences of both lives the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) is not aware of what is going on in this world. He does not know who is asking help from him, and who is seeking child, wealth, wife, etc.</b> from him as practiced by the grave worshippers. The Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&quot;Lo! Some men from my followers will be brought and then (the angels) will drive them to the left side (Hell-Fire). I will say. 'O my Lord! (They are) my companions!' Then a reply will come (from Almighty), 'You do not know what they did after you.'&quot;</i>[al-Bukhari].  This Hadith proves that he does not know the matters of this world after his death otherwise he will be aware of the situations of his people. 
</p><p>On the other hand, if it is said that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam) is alive in his grave, it does not mean that his life is similar to the life of those who are living in this world. So, <b>if one seeks his help asks something from him he commits Shirk (polytheism).</b> 
</p>
Finally, what we mentioned above is the sole truth that is approved in Qur'an and Sunnah, whoever believes so is a true Muslim and whoever opposes such a person, insults him and accuses him of Kufr (disbelief) is committing a great sin, since he is considering a Muslim person Kafir without any reason.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=86435?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=86435">Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, died and is buried in Madinah</a><br>IslamWeb, Fatwa No. 86435, June 10, 2003</div></div>
