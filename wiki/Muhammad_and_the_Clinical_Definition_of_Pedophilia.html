<p>Many <a href="wiki/Critics_of_Islam.html" title="Critics of Islam">critics</a> of <a href="wiki/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> claim Muhammad's relationship with Aisha was a pedophilic relationship, therefore Muhammad was a pedophile. 
</p>
<div class="quotes">Aisha (Allah be pleased with her) reported: &quot;Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and I was admitted to his house when I was nine years old.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3310#008.3310">8:3310</a></div></div>
<p>In psychiatry, the most commonly used diagnostic criteria for diagnosing psychiatric ailments are those from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders. The latest issue is DSM-IV-TR. The DSM classification is a system that classifies and defines all accepted psychiatric ailments and symptoms, with their inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following are the inclusion and exclusion criteria for pedophilia (302.2):
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pedophilia_according_to_DSM-IV-TR">Pedophilia according to DSM-IV-TR</span></h3>
<div class="quotes"><b>A.</b> Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger).
<p><b>B.</b> The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies caused marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
</p>
<b>C.</b> The person is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A. <br><br><i>Note: This does not include an individual in late adolescence involved in an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old.</i><br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=10307?aID=10307">Diagnostic Critiera for Pedophilia</a><br>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Psychiatry Online</div></div>
<div class="quotes">&quot;According to the DSM-IV definition, pedophilia involves sexual activity by an adult with a prepubescent child. Some individuals prefer females, usually 8- to 10-year-olds. Those attracted to males usually prefers slightly older children. Some prefer both sexes. While some are sexually attracted only to children, others also are sometimes attracted to adults. 
<p>Pedophiliac activity may involve undressing and looking at the child or more direct physical sex acts. All these activities are psychologically harmful to the child, and some may be physically harmful. In addition, individuals with pedophilia often go to great lengths to obtain photos, films or pornographic publications that focus on sex with children. 
</p>
These individuals commonly explain their activities with excuses or rationalizations that the activities have &quot;educational value&quot; for the child, that the child feels &quot;sexual pleasure&quot; from the activities or that the child was &quot;sexually provocative.&quot; However, child psychiatrists and other child development experts maintain that children are incapable of offering informed consent to sex with an adult. Furthermore, since pedophiliac acts harm the child, psychiatrists condemn publications or organizations that seek to promote or normalize sex between adults and children.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060508052445/http://www.medem.com/medlb/article_detaillb.cfm?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&sub_cat=355?article_ID=ZZZUZRUZGLC&sub_cat=355">Diagnostic Critiera for Pedophilia</a><br>Medem Medical Library</div></div>
<p>In the following article, it will be shown that Muhammad's relationship with Aisha did indeed meet all the criteria to make the diagnosis of pedophilia, and therefore Muhammad was undoubtedly a pedophile.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis">Analysis</span></h2>
<p><a href="wiki/Apologists.html" title="Apologists">Apologists</a> will often claim that Aisha had reached puberty by the time Muhammad married and had sexual intercourse with her. However, they never provide verifiable proof for this assertion. Instead, they rely on the pre-Islamic culture and traditional practices of 7<sup>th</sup> Century Arabia as evidence of their claim. 
</p><p>To prove that Aisha was still pre-pubescent when Muhammad married and had sex with her, one has to understand Ibn Hajar's explanation of the permissibility of doll-playing for pre-pubescent girls in Islam. Applying this doll-playing exegesis to the ahadith of Aisha getting married or when she first had sex with Muhammad, one can effectively demonstrate that she was pre-pubescent on these occasions This evidence will be examined in the following three sections.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Only_pre-pubescent_girls_were_allowed_to_play_with_dolls">Only pre-pubescent girls were allowed to play with dolls</span></h3>
<p>This is what the great hadith scholar, Shaykh al-Islam Imam Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar Al-'Asqalani, Commander of the Faithful in Hadith, Qadi of Egypt, had to say in regards to doll-playing and little girls in his celebrated commentary on Sahih Bukhari, &quot;Fateh al-Bari&quot;:
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sahih_Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (<b>The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty</b>.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13)<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Bukhari</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/073-sbt.php#008.073.151#008.073.151">8:73:151</a></div></div>
<p>How do we know that it was Ibn Hajar who made the above (bolded) doll-playing exegesis? We know this by the reference to Fateh-al-Bari and also due to the fact that when we look at other translations of Bukhari 8:73:151, the same message is conveyed.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_Translations">Alternative Translations</span></h5>
<p><b>One</b> 
</p>
<div class="quotes">On the authority of Aisha (RA), who said: I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (SAW). And I had girl-friends (playmates) who played along with me. They would hide (feeling shy) from him (SAW) whenever he entered. But, he (SAW) would send for them to join me and they would play with me. (Sahih Bukhari &amp; Muslim)<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428180522/http://www.themuslimwoman.com/beware/GirlsPlayingDolls.htm&date=2012-02-15?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428180522/http://www.themuslimwoman.com/beware/GirlsPlayingDolls.htm&date=2012-02-15">Little Girls Playing With Dolls</a><br>The Islamic Ruling Concerning Tasweer, Abu Muhammad Abdur-Ra'uf Shakir</div></div>
<p>The translator then provides some discussion on translations of various versions of this hadith before he follows up with Ibn Hajar and Fath-al-Bari:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baaree (Fath al-Baaree, no. 6130, Kitaab: al-Adab, Baab: al-Inbisaat ilaa an-Naas): This Hadith has been used as a proof for the permissibility of possessing (suwar - of) dolls and toys for the purpose of the little girls playing with them. This has been especially exempted from the general prohibition of possession of images (suwar).<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428180522/http://www.themuslimwoman.com/beware/GirlsPlayingDolls.htm&date=2012-02-15?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428180522/http://www.themuslimwoman.com/beware/GirlsPlayingDolls.htm&date=2012-02-15">Little Girls Playing With Dolls</a><br>The Islamic Ruling Concerning Tasweer, Abu Muhammad Abdur-Ra'uf Shakir</div></div>
<p><b>Two</b> 
</p>
<div class="quotes">But if these images and dolls are toys for children, the Sunnah indicates that they are permissible. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and I had female friends who would play with me…” al-Bukhaari, 6130; Muslim, 2440. 
Ibn Hajar said: This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to have images of girls (i.e., dolls) and toys for girls to play with. This is an exception from the general meaning of the prohibition on having images. This was stated by ‘Iyaad and was narrated from the majority. They permitted the sale of dolls to girls so as to teach them from a young age how to take care of their homes and children. Ibn Hibbaan stated that it is permissible for young girls to play with toys…<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/49844&date=2012-02-15?url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/49844&date=2012-02-15">He is asking about dolls and three-dimensional toys, and whether that affects his fast</a><br>Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 49844</div></div>
<p><b>Three</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Aaishah said, “I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (pbuh), and my girlfriends used to play along with me. Whenever, Allaah's Messenger (pbuh) would enter, they would hide from him. So he called them to play with me.”
In the classical commentary on Saheeh al-Bukhaare entitled Fat-h al-Baaree, Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalaanee wrote the following: “This hadeeth is used as evidence for the permissibility of making dolls and toys with human and animal forms for the purpose of girls playing with them. This category has been specifically excluded from the general prohibition against making images. ‘Iyaad stated this to be categorically so and related that it was the position of the majority of scholars. He further related that they permitted the selling of toys for girls in order to train them from their youth in their household affairs and in dealing with their children…”<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060617200109/http://www.bilalphilips.com/books/eemaan/eemaan05.htm&date=2012-02-15?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060617200109/http://www.bilalphilips.com/books/eemaan/eemaan05.htm&date=2012-02-15">Fatwa on the use of Images for children (p.1)</a><br>BilalPhilips.com</div></div>
<p>Note the great similarity in the commentary of Ibn Hajar in Fateh al-Bari to all four versions of the hadith. The words are different due to the different translators but the essential message is unchanged – <i>only little girls (i.e. before puberty) are permitted to play with dolls</i>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Does_the_phrase_.27little_girls.27_mean_pre-pubescent.3F">Does the phrase 'little girls' mean pre-pubescent?</span></h4>
<p>How do we know that these &quot;little girls&quot; are pre-pubescent? This is due to Islamic customs and laws specifically stating so.
</p><p><b>For example:</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Girls reach puberty and adulthood when they experience the above three signs. However, they have a fourth sign, that is, menstruation (hayd). Whenever a girl experiences it, she is a woman even if she is 12 years old.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071225201745/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html&date=2012-02-15?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071225201745/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_21.html&date=2012-02-15">For Whom is Fasting Necessary?</a><br>USC - Muslim Students Association, Compendium of Muslim Texts</div></div>
<div class="quotes"><b>Islam And the Age of Puberty</b><br><br>Islam clearly teaches that adulthood starts when a person have attained puberty.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071031090648/http://www.alinaam.org.za/social/myaaisha.htm&date=2012-02-15?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071031090648/http://www.alinaam.org.za/social/myaaisha.htm&date=2012-02-15">The Young Marriage of `Âishah(R)</a><br>Madrassah In'aamiyya</div></div>
<p>These Islamic <a href="wiki/Websites.html" title="Websites">websites</a> provide us with the evidence, that in Islam when a girl reaches puberty, she ceases to be considered a girl and becomes a woman. Therefore, little girls must be pre-pubescent according to Islamic customs and laws.
</p><p><b>We also have commentaries by hadith scholars that reinforce this point:</b>
</p>
<div class="quotes">Al-Qaadee 'Iyaad has stated this position with definiteness, and transmitted it as the position of the Majority (Jumhoor) of the Scholars; and that they declared permissible the selling of toys/dolls (al-lu'ab) for little girls, to train them from childhood for the household responsibilities and child-rearing. 
Al-Khattaabee said: … it is understood that playing with dolls (al-banaat) is not like the amusement from other images (suwar) concerning which the threat (wa'eed) of punishment is mentioned. The only reason why permission in this was given to Aisha (RA) is because she had not, at that time, reached the age of puberty.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428180522/http://www.themuslimwoman.com/beware/GirlsPlayingDolls.htm&date=2012-02-15?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110428180522/http://www.themuslimwoman.com/beware/GirlsPlayingDolls.htm&date=2012-02-15">Little Girls Playing With Dolls</a><br>The Islamic Ruling Concerning Tasweer, Abu Muhammad Abdur-Ra'uf Shakir</div></div>
<div class="quotes">… Abu 'Ubaid, who said: We don't see there being any reason for that (permission to play with her dolls), except due to the fact that these toys are a source of amusement (lahw) for the children.

<div class="quotes">“My mother came to me while I was being swung on a swing between two branches and got me down. My nurse took over and wiped my face with some water and started leading me. When I was at the door she stopped so I could catch my breath. I was brought in while Muhammad was sitting on a bed in our house. My mother made me sit on his lap. The other men and women got up and left. The Prophet consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old.

<p>This hadith suggests that Muhammad had sex with Aisha in her house on her wedding day. However, was this event really on her wedding day? This is proven by the Sahih Bukhari hadith below. Note the similarity in accounts, although the Bukhari 5:58:234 hadith is more expansive on the fact that the events took place on Aisha’s wedding day:
</p>
<div class="quotes">Narrated Aisha: &quot;The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of six (years). We went to Medina and stayed at the home of Bani-al-Harith bin Khazraj. Then I got ill and my hair fell down. Later on my hair grew (again) and my mother, Um Ruman, came to me while I was playing in a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Alright, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house.

<p>Also note that Sahih Muslim says Aisha still had her dolls with her when she was taken to Muhammad’s house as a bride. Applying Ibn Hajar’s doll-playing exegesis from Part 1, it becomes clear that Aisha was pre-pubescent when she became a bride.
</p><p>Therefore, it is abundantly clear from the hadiths, that Aisha was pre-pubescent when Muhammad first had sex with her on her wedding day.

<p>Apologists will insist that the term &quot;<a href="wiki/The_Meaning_of_Consummate.html" title="The Meaning of Consummate">consummate the marriage</a>&quot; means the completion of the '<a href="wiki/Nikah.html" title="Nikah" class="mw-redirect">nikah</a>' ceremony, not sex. This is in spite of the Abu-Dawud hadith Vol. 2, No. 2116 translation that explicitly states <i> 'intercourse' </i>. Be that as it may, does 'consummate the marriage' mean sex? Here is proof that it does. In Sahih Bukhari, vol. 7, No. 64, the root word used is &quot;dakhala&quot;. From the Hans-Wehr Arabic-English Dictionary:
</p>
<div class="quotes">
to enter, to pierce, to penetrate, to consummate the marriage, cohabit, sleep with a woman.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> Hans-Wehr Arabic-English Dictionary, P. 273</div></div>
<p>But how do we know that at the age of nine Aisha was still pre-pubescent? Here is the evidence from Sunan Abu-Dawud, Vol. 3, No. 4914 (This hadith is also repeated in Sunan Nasa’i):
</p>
<div class="quotes">On the authority of Aisha (RA), that she said: The Messenger of Allah (SAW) returned from the battle of Tabook or Khaibar (the narrator of the hadith was in doubt about whether he was told &quot;Tabook or Khaibar.&quot;). There was a curtain covering her 'sahwah' (chamber or small room in front of the house). The wind blew a side of the curtain and uncovered Aisha's dolls. He (SAW) said: What is this, O Aisha? She said: My dolls. The he (SAW) saw amongst them a horse with two wings from scraps of cloth. He (SAW) said: What is this which I see amongst them (amongst the dolls)? She said: A horse. He asked: What is upon it? She said: Two wings. He (SAW) asked (in astonishment): A horse with two wings? She said: Didn't you hear that Sulaiman (Solomon - AS) had horses with wings? She said: Then he (SAW) laughed until I saw his molar teeth.<sup id="cite_ref-Abu_Muhammad_AbdurRauf_Shakir_1-0" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muhammad_and_the_Clinical_Definition_of_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-Abu_Muhammad_AbdurRauf_Shakir-1">[1]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref"> Abu Daawood, An-Nasaa'iee as-Sunan al-Kubraa, Albani (ra) says the chain of narrators of an-Nasaa'ee is authentic (Saheeh). As for the chain of narrators of Abu Daawood, Albani (ra) has also declared it to be authentic (saheeh)</div></div> 
<p>Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-'Adheem Aabaadee, in his Sharh (explanation) of Sunan Abu-Dawud, says: 
</p>
<div class="quotes">This hadith and the one before it (Hadith #20) is used as an evidence of permissibility of possession of dolls and toys for the purpose of little girls playing with them. This (permission) is a special exception from the general prohibition of possession of images (suwar). This position has been stated with certainty by al-Qaadee 'Iyaad, and he has quoted it as the opinion of the Jumhoor (Majority of Scholars). He also said that the Jumhoor has allowed the sale of toys (dolls) for little girls, in order to train and prepare them from childhood for their household affairs and the raising of their children.
<p>According to the generally accepted tradition, Aisha was born about eight years before Hijrah. The battle of Khaibar took place in Muharram-Safar 7 AH. The siege of Tabuk took place in Rajab 9 AH. Therefore, to be generous, I will accept the Khaibar explanation and not the later, Tabuk explanation.
</p>
It is generally accepted that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of 6 in the year 3 BH. This is confirmed by reports that the marriage was consummated in Shawwal, which came seven months after the Prophet's hijra from Makkah to al-Medinah.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"> Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-'Adheem Aabaadee </div></div>
<p>So the Abu-Dawud hadith says that Aisha was still playing with dolls as late as 7 AH. That is 6 or 7 years after her marriage. Using the doll-playing exegesis of Ibn Hajar, Abu Ubaid, al-Qaadee 'Iyaad, and Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq, Aisha did not reach puberty until at least 6 to 7 years after her marriage when she would have been about 15 or 16 years old, but lets say 14 years old to be generous.

<p>The evidence that this hadith is indeed sahih, and that the phrase &quot;the narrator is doubtful&quot; does not mean to imply that the hadith itself is doubtful, but the fact that the narrator was doubtful in regards to whether or not he was told it was Khaybar or Tabuk, is as follows:

<p>Authoritative Islamic scholars still use this hadith in their judgment of Islamic laws and customs. Shaykh Abdul Azeez al-Qaari' (Imaam of Masjid Qubaa and professor of tafsir and Quranic recitation at the Islamic University of Madeenah) had this to say about image-making in al-Usrah:
</p>
<div class="quotes">“Regarding the hadeeth of Aaishah that she played with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (pbuh), and, in some versions of the hadeeth, that one of the dolls was in the shape of a winged horse, and that when the Prophet (pbuh) asked her about it, she replied, ‘Didn't you hear that [Prophet] Sulayman had a horse with wings?’ to which the Prophet (pbuh) responded by laughing; this hadeeth indicates the permissibility of children’s figurative toys, owning them and using them, whether they are clearly representative or not, and whether skillfully or crudely fashioned. There is no basis in the hadeeth for making a distinction. Those who say that Aaishah's dolls were not distinctly representative have made an arbitrary judgement not based on any evidence. What do they say about a winged horse?”<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Muhammad_and_the_Clinical_Definition_of_Pedophilia.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><br> <div class="quotes_ref">Shaykh Abdul Azeez al-Qaari'</div></div>
<p>How can apologists claim that the Imam of Masjid Qubaa and professor of tafsir and Quranic recitation at the Islamic University of Medina uses a hadith that is not sahih in deciding the permissibility of doll-playing among Saudi Arabian children? For by doing so, even Shaykh Abdul Azeez al-Qaari' of Saudi Arabia seems to accept that this hadith is sahih.
</p><p>If using a weak hadith, a scholar must warn the reader of its weakness:
</p>
<div class="quotes">“Generally, in Islamic law, only the authentic (sahih) and good (hasan) hadiths are used in deriving the rules. The weak (da`if) hadiths have no value for the purpose of Shari`ah. However, the scholars of hadith sometimes differ among themselves in the determination of whether some Hadiths are weak or not. The scholars have sometimes used weak hadiths for moral and spiritual (fada'il) matters. It is important that when one uses a weak hadith for any reason, one should explain it to the people that this is weak hadith and that it is being used for this particular reason.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&cid=1158658459858&pagename=Zone-English-Living_Shariah%2FLSELayout?c=Article_C&cid=1158658459858&pagename=Zone-English-Living_Shariah%2FLSELayout">What is the Value of a Weak Hadith?</a><br>Islam Online, Muzammil H.

<ul><li> In the first section, it was shown that in Islam, doll-playing girls are pre-pubescent according to the doll-playing exegesis of Ibn Hajar and Islamic laws and customs.</li>
<li> In the second section it was shown, using Ibn Hajar's doll-playing exegesis that Aisha remained a pre-pubescent child when she was married and had sexual intercourse with Muhammad.</li>
<li> In the third section it was shown that Aisha remained pre-pubescent as late as 6 or 7 years after her marriage to Muhammad.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Does Muhammad meet all the criteria needed to be classed a Pedophile?
</p>
<dl><dd><i>Criteria A: Over a period of at least six months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger).</i></dd></dl>
<p>Yes, Muhammad had sexual relations with a pre-pubescent child over a prolonged period - likely to have been at least 6 to 7 years.
</p>
<dl><dd><i>Criteria B: The person has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies caused marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</i></dd></dl>
<p>Yes, Muhammad had acted on his sexual urges - as demonstrated by Tabari IX:131 and various other Bukhari ahadith that state that consummation had taken place at the age of nine when it had been established that Aisha had not reached puberty until she was at least 14 years of age.
</p>
<dl><dd><i>Criteria C: The person is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A.</i></dd></dl>
<p>Yes, Muhammad was 54 years old while Aisha was only 9 years old at the time of sexual intercourse.
</p><p>Therefore, even according to the most stringent clinical definition of pedophilia, the DSM-IV-TR, Muhammad would be found guilty as charged.
