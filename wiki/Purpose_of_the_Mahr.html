<p>Mahr is the amount of money to be paid by the groom to the bride, at the time of marriage. As seen in the above video clip, the apologetic claim made for this provision of a mahr is that it is a token of goodwill given by the husband to the wife as a demonstration that he will be able to support her financially throughout the marriage. However the <a href="wiki/Qur'an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> and <a href="wiki/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">ahadith</a> make it clear that this is not its true purpose.

<p>Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that when asked whether it was permissible for a man to return to his wife if he had divorced her irrevocably and then another man had married her after him and died before consummating the marriage, al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said, &quot;It is not halal for the first husband to return to her.&quot;

<p>Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Said ibn al-Musayyab and from Sulayman ibn Yasar that Tulayha al-Asadiya was the wife of Rushayd ath-Thaqafi. He divorced her, and she got married in her idda-period. Umar ibn al-Khattab beat her and her husband with a stick several times, and separated them. Then Umar ibn al-Khattab said, &quot;If a woman marries in her idda-period, and the new husband has not consummated the marriage, then separate them, and when she has completed the idda of her first husband, the other becomes a suitor. If he has consummated the marriage then separate them. Then she must complete her idda from her first husband, and then the idda from the other one, and they are never to be reunited.&quot;

So I remained with her for three (nights), and then Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded us to part with them (such women). <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Sahih Muslim</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3258#008.3258">8:3258</a> </div></div>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to debate whether temporary marriage is still permissible or not. The fact is that temporary marriage once was, and so the question remains; if the apologetics claim regarding the purpose of giving a mahr is correct, why was a mahr required when contracting a temporary marriage? In other words, if the mahr is simply a demonstration of a man's ability and willingness to provide financially for his wife throughout a marriage and <i>not</i> payment for sexual relations, then why, in a temporary marriage contracted for the purpose of short-term sexual relations, is a mahr required?

<p>Although the mahr is not given as a fixed amount, it is made clear that the mahr is dependent upon the woman's social status. She cannot be given less of a mahr if she is an <a href="wiki/Dealing_Justly_with_Wives_and_Orphans_(Qur'an_4-3).html" title="Dealing Justly with Wives and Orphans (Qur'an 4:3)"> orphan</a> or old; or for any other reason not dictated by the Qur'an or the ahadith. If she is a free woman then she is entitled to a mahr of the same value as any other free woman. Slaves are not of the same social status so they are not entitled to a mahr of the same value. The Qur'an makes it clear that you must be fair when giving a mahr:

<div class="quotes">
And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans, then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four; but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them), then (marry) only one or what your right hands possess; this is more proper, that you may not deviate from the right course. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.003#004.003">4:3</a> </div></div>

And whoever among you has not within his power ampleness of means to marry free believing women, then (he may marry) of those whom your right hands possess from among your believing maidens; and Allah knows best your faith: you are (sprung) the one from the other; so marry them with the permission of their masters, and give them their dowries justly, they being chaste, not fornicating, nor receiving paramours; and when they are taken in marriage, then if they are guilty of indecency, they shall suffer half the punishment which is (inflicted) upon free women.

He uncovered his thigh and I saw the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, he said, 'Allahu Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a (hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who have been warned.' He repeated this thrice. The people came out for their jobs and some of them said, 'Muhammad (has come).' (Some of our companions added, &quot;With his army.&quot;) We conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, 'O Allah's Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.' The Prophet said, 'Go and take any slave girl.' He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to the Prophet and said, 'O Allah's Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and An-Nadir and she befits none but you.' So the Prophet said, 'Bring him along with her.' So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, he said to Dihya, 'Take any slave girl other than her from the captives.'

Thabit asked Anas, '<b>&quot;O Abu Hamza!

<p>The ahadith above present another problem for the mahr apologists. If it were true, that the mahr is an advance demonstration of a man's ability to financially support his wife, why then did <a href="wiki/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> not mention this in any of the aforementioned narrations? Furthermore, in the narrations dealing with the Qur'an recitations, we see both Muhammad and the man in question knew that he had nothing material to give as a mahr. This clearly shows he was not financially stable and that the mahr in this case could not possibly have been a token of financial stability. This is why he had to resort to 'giving' his new bride his Qur'an memorizations. These narrations are a recount of a conversation Muhammad himself allegedly had. This means that Muhammad himself has confirmed that the apologist is wrong, and that the Mahr is simply given as payment for lawful sexual relations

Then as to those whom you profit by, give them their dowries as appointed; and there is no blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appointed; surely Allah is Knowing, Wise. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/004-qmt.php#004.024#004.024">4:24</a> </div></div>

<div class="quotes"> And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have appointed for them a portion, then (pay to them) half of what you have appointed, unless they relinquish or he should relinquish in whose hand is the marriage tie; and it is nearer to righteousness that you should relinquish; and do not neglect the giving of free gifts between you; surely Allah sees what you do. <br> <div class="quotes_ref"> <a href="wiki/Compendium_of_Muslim_Texts.html" title="Compendium of Muslim Texts">Qur'an</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.237#002.237">2:237</a> </div></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>The purpose of the mahr as explained by the Islamic texts is clear; it is a payment from a man to a women; payment in full for the future sexual relations (nikah) he will have with her. This is illustrated by the requirement for a mahr in temporary &quot;marriages&quot;, the statements of Prophet Muhammad, and the fact that a mahr cannot be taken back (except under extenuating circumstances) because the man has availed himself of the service for which it was payment. The apologetic claim that it is simply a demonstrative token of his ability to financially support his wife does not hold up to scrutiny once all of the evidence is examined. Even the Qur'an alone makes it clear this is incorrect.
