<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pakistan:_Hospital_staff_show_zero-tolerance_towards_non-Muslim_colleagues.2C_11_poisoned_during_Ramadan">Pakistan: Hospital staff show zero-tolerance towards non-Muslim colleagues, 11 poisoned during Ramadan</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">At least 11 nurses, including three Christians, were poisoned at Civil Hospital Karachi for eating during Ramadan. During their afternoon break yesterday, the 11 nurses went to the hostel cafeteria for some tea and food. Rita, a Catholic nurse, collapsed first after drinking her tea. Now all the nurses are in the hospital's intensive care unit, some in very serious conditions.
<p>In Pakistan, eating in public during the Muslim month of fasting is illegal. For Muslims, fasting is compulsory. However, hospital workers and travellers are exempt.
</p><p>Civil Hospital Karachi staff is made up mostly of Muslims who do not tolerate that their non-Muslim colleagues eat during Ramadan.
</p><p>In the wake of the incident, hospital officials have opened an inquiry to find the culprits.
</p><p>The Masihi Foundation, a Christian rights organisation, and Life for All have condemned the incident, calling it a &quot;vile act&quot; against religious freedom and tolerance.
</p>
Political and religious leaders have also slammed the action.  For Sindh Saleem Khokahr, a member of the Provincial Assembly and president of the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, &quot;poisoning someone for eating in Ramadan is a barbaric act and must be condemned. There are many Muslims who do not fast during Ramadan. These nurses were poisoned for eating in their cafeteria, not in public.&quot;<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/In-Karachi,-11nurses-drink-tea-laced-with-poison-during-Ramadan-25430.html&date=2012-08-01?url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/In-Karachi,-11nurses-drink-tea-laced-with-poison-during-Ramadan-25430.html&date=2012-08-01">In Karachi, 11nurses drink tea laced with poison during Ramadan</a><br>Jibran Khan, Asia News, July 31, 2012</div></div>

</p><p>Following an audit ordered by the federal government after reports in The Australian raised concerns about the school’s financial relationship with the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Malek Fahd has been told to repay funding given to the school by NSW since 2010 and remains ineligible for state government funds… 
</p><p>In August last year, an investigation by The Australian revealed that AFIC had been charging Malek Fahd millions of dollars in “management fees” for non-existent services and inflated rents…

<div class="quotes">The number of beggars have gone up significantly during the holy month of Ramadan, according to top police officials in Dubai.
<p>The authorities running the anti-begging campaign arrested 37 people last week alone. On Monday a teenage boy in hijab was also caught begging.
</p><p>The youngster was moving around with a group of women, said Col Salem Khalifa Al Rumaithi, Deputy CID Director, Search and Investigation, Dubai Police.
</p><p>The 15-year-old  boy told investigating officers that he was tempted to beg because of the acitivities of the group he belonged to.
</p><p>Rumaithi urged public to co-operate with police to report beggars. Children was victims of begging. Adults exploit them for their greed and spoil their future, he added.
</p>
About 65 beggars have been arrested so far this year. Between July 17 and 24 police arrested 28 beggars including four women.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/male-beggar-dressed-in-hijab-arrested-in-dubai-2012-07-31-1.469498&date=2012-07-31?url=http://www.emirates247.com/crime/local/male-beggar-dressed-in-hijab-arrested-in-dubai-2012-07-31-1.469498&date=2012-07-31">Male beggar dressed in hijab arrested in Dubai</a><br>Emirates 24/7, July 31, 2012</div></div>

<div class="quotes">The Special Fraud Unit of Nigerian Police  in its continuous clampdown on fraudsters has nabbed some swindlers who parade themselves as Muslim clerics to defraud innocent members of the public their hard earned money.
<p>The petitioner alleged that sometime in October 2011, one Lawal Suleiman collected his goods (fireworks) valued at N13, 320, 750.00 with the promise to pay as soon as the goods were delivered. That the goods were delivered successfully but the suspect refused to pay.
</p><p>He further stated that on 18th June, 2012, he got a message from the suspects elder brother who informed him that his brother was swindled by some fraudsters at Ilorin, Kwara State. The fraudsters are Fatai Bamidele and Lateef Ahmed.
</p><p>Fatai Bamidele, 34 year old hail from Irepodun Local Govt. area of Kwara State. He claimed to be a Muslim cleric who normally assists Lawal Suleiman in his spiritual life. He stated that Lawal Suleiman came to him to seek special assistance concerning the bad dream he had and also that he needed more power and more money.
</p><p>This request for more money prompted him to introduce him to one Alhaji Lateef Ahmed in Ilorin who happens to be his master and superior.

<div class="quotes">Animal rights activists have launched a campaign online to demand that Egypt improve the conditions of animals at zoos across the country. The petition, now circulating on The Petition Site, said that zoos in the country are “starving, torturing, abusing poor defenseless animals.”
<p>The call for action singled out zoos in Giza, Alexandria, Fayoum, Kafr el-Sheikh and al-Arish as places that need immediate attention.
</p><p>At the Kafr el-Sheikh facility in the Nile Delta, the campaign said the animals are often mistreated and abused by the guards. The petition reported that one of the lions, Antar, faces massive abuse and “his mate (Abla) keeps looking after him and tries best to soothe him,” after the guards continue to terrify him.
</p><p>At the same facility, they pointed to a female tiger, Samar, who “is malnourished and looks distraught, she is skin and bone.” The activists said guards feed her “with a metal rod, which has a little piece of meat on the end of it only when the guard is paid to feed her. This is complete brutality.”
</p><p>The petition links to a Facebook page showing images of the inhumane treatment facing animals in Egypt.

Egypt has long struggled to find peace and justice for its captive animals. At the Lion’s Village an hour and a half hours north of Cairo, animals are kept in cages no larger than one meter squared.

<div class="quotes">Three liquor stores recently sold booze to a 14-year-old boy whose identity was hidden because he was wearing a full-length burka and face veil at the time, a Sun News Network exclusive has found.
<p>The teenager, clad in an Islamic female's traditional garb of a burka, headscarf and facial covering, shopped in three different LCBO stores north of Toronto last Wednesday.
</p><p>In each location, the Grade 8 student paid cash for a bottle of sambuca liqueur.
</p><p>Ontario's Liquor Licence Act requires that before liquor is sold, government-issued photo ID -- a drivers licence, for example -- must be inspected if the buyer is suspected of being under the legal drinking age of 19.
</p><p>Under the LCBO's Check 25 program, employees can ask for ID from people who appear under age 25 -- a policy implemented in 1997 to prevent young people who appear older than their actual age from purchasing alcohol.
</p><p>The stunt was co-ordinated and video recorded by Sun News Network host David Menzies, who has made a career out of lambasting Canada's politically correct institutions.
</p><p>Menzies said the unopened bottles -- totalling just over $80 -- were promptly taken from the teen.
</p><p>But Menzies suggested the fact the boy was never asked to uncover his face or show photo identification at multiple store locations reveals a deeply ingrained reluctance on the part of Canadian institutions to challenge cultural practices, even when they conflict with broader societal goals such as preventing underage drinking.
</p><p><br>
&quot;The reason why you have to unveil is that is photo ID is absolutely useless if you don't see the actual face of the person,&quot; Menzies said, adding he came up with the idea after an acquaintance told him he had seen this happen at various LCBO locations.
</p>
&quot;They didn't ask for an unveiling, and they didn't even ask for (photo identification) ... You say you're socially responsible, you have the policy codified ... but nobody follows it,&quot; Menzies said Monday.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/canada/archives/2012/07/20120724-071541.html&date=2012-08-07?url=http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/canada/archives/2012/07/20120724-071541.html&date=2012-08-07">LCBO sells booze to 14-year-old wearing burka</a><br>Terry Davidson, QMI Agency, July 24, 2012</div></div>

<p>Irfan Patel, 33, pleaded guilty to four counts of cruelty to a person under the age of 16 at Preston Crown Court yesterday. 
</p><p>Using an Urdu translator to enter his plea, the teacher of several years, showed no emotion. 
</p><p>The court heard Patel used physical violence to discipline the boys aged between 10 and 16 between January 1, 2011 and October 19, 2011. 
</p><p>He used to strike the children around the back of the head and on the back with his fists during religious lessons at the mosque.
</p><p>The court also heard Patel, of Pelham Street, Blackburn, wore a ring which he used to inflict more pain. 
</p><p>The assistant teacher also admitted forcing the children to adopt 'awkward' positions, including the chicken position, a well known torture tactic used in war zones. 
</p><p>Other positions included forcing the boys to crouch down while holding their ears and standing for long periods of time touching their toes.

<div class="quotes">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Iran for the bombing of a bus which killed at least seven Israelis in a Bulgarian resort.
<p>He said &quot;all signs point to Iran&quot; and said Israel would &quot;respond with force&quot;.
</p><p>It is not clear whether the attack was a suicide bombing outside the Sarafovo airport or whether explosives had been packed onto the bus and then detonated. The Bulgarian Interior Ministy confirmed the explosion had been a terrorist attack.
</p><p>Local media in the resort of Burgas claim the bus was packed with Israelis, possibly members of a young basketball team on their way to a training camp. 
</p><p>Reports suggest as many as seven people have been killed. Around 30 people have been taken to hospital to be treated for their injuries, while the airport has been closed in the wake of the attack. It is feared three pregnant women were among those injured.
</p>
The explosion is thought to have occurred at around 6pm local time (4pm BST). A flight from Tel Aviv had arrived around one hour earlier. All flights from Israel to Bulgaria have now been suspended.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/70198/israelis-killed-bulgaria-bus-suicide-bombing&date=2012-08-01?url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/70198/israelis-killed-bulgaria-bus-suicide-bombing&date=2012-08-01">Israelis killed in Bulgaria bus suicide bombing</a><br>Marcus Dysch, The Jewish Chronicle, July 18, 2012</div></div>

<div class="quotes">Five men and a woman suspected of terrorism offences have been arrested in London as part of an intelligence-led investigation involving MI5.
<p>One of the six, who are aged between 18 and 30, was Tasered by police. Eight homes in west, east and north London and one business have been searched.

</p><p>Three of those held are brothers - one an ex-police community support officer.

Richard Dart, a Muslim convert who uses the name Salahuddin al Britani, was also detained in the raids, it is understood.

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Updates:">Updates:</span></h5>
<div class="quotes">HATE cleric Anjem Choudary has described white Islamic extremist Richard Dart as a “victim” and said his terror plot was an act of “resistance”.
<p>Bearded Dart, 29, is one of three fanatics facing long jail terms for a string of hate crimes.
</p><p>Last week a court heard how ex-BBC security guard Dart and self-confessed terrorist Imran Mahmood plotted to target Royal Wootton Bassett, Wilts, where people line the streets to welcome home the bodies of British soldiers killed in Afghanistan.
</p><p>Dart also talked about killing the heads of MI5 and MI6 and with a third man, ex-police support officer Jehangir Alom, planned to go to Pakistan for terror training.
</p><p>But twisted Choudary, who groomed Dart, said the terror bid was just “an act of resistance”.
</p><p>Despite Dart’s guilty plea, Choudary said the men were victims of the UK’s “oppressive” legal system.
</p><p>He said Dart’s visit could have been innocent and added: “Terrorism, according to the British government, is any Muslim that wishes to defend their Muslim brothers and sisters.
</p>
“They could have been abroad for a myriad of reasons but because they are Muslims they can expect no leniency.”..<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4845771/Hate-cleric-Anjem-Choudary-calls-Richard-Dart-victim.html&date=2013-03-19?url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4845771/Hate-cleric-Anjem-Choudary-calls-Richard-Dart-victim.html&date=2013-03-19">Preacher in ‘victim’ rant over Brit Dart</a><br>The Sun, March 17, 2013</div></div>
<div class="quotes">Richard Dart was jailed for six years, Imran Mahmood received nine years and nine months and Jahangir Alom was jailed for four years and six months.
<p>The London-based trio, who pleaded guilty in March, discussed targeting the town of Royal Wootton Bassett.
</p><p>The judge said the three were &quot;committed to acts of terrorism&quot;.
</p><p>They were arrested in the capital city weeks before the Olympic Games.
</p><p>'<b>For Allah'</b>
</p><p>Dart, 30, of Broadway, Ealing, west London, and Mahmood, 22, from Dabbs Hill Lane, Northolt, west London, were both born in the UK. Alom, 26, of Abbey Road, Stratford, was born in Bangladesh but is a British citizen.
</p><p>Mr Justice Simon told them they held &quot;radical Islamist beliefs and have shown yourselves to be committed to acts of terrorism&quot;.
</p><p>Dart refused to stand when he was sentenced, and said: &quot;I don't wish to stand up, I believe ruling and judging is only for Allah.&quot;
</p><p>The judge said that they were all &quot;committed fundamentalists&quot; who would have been prepared to kill.
</p><p>Mahmood and Dart were both given extended sentences, meaning that they will serve two-thirds of their prison terms rather than half, and they will spend five years on licence.
</p><p>He told Dart and Mahmood: &quot;I'm satisfied to the required criminal standard that neither of you had ruled out an attack in the United Kingdom, and that you, Mahmood, were looking at arming yourself with a bomb.&quot;
</p><p>After the sentencing, the Metropolitan Police said the convictions followed a painstaking investigation by the Met's counter-terrorism command and security services that had uncovered secret conversations about potential attacks in the UK and abroad.
</p><p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, head of the Met's counter-terrorism command, said the investigation had involved a &quot;mixture of dedicated, diligent traditional detective work combined with the latest technology and computer techniques&quot;.
</p><p>He said the trio were &quot;dangerous men&quot;.
</p>
&quot;This case serves as a classic example of how terrorists live in our midst while preparing their acts and their determination to travel overseas to train before returning to the UK,&quot; he said...<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22294720&date=2013-04-25?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22294720&date=2013-04-25">UK trio jailed for preparing acts of terrorism</a><br>BBC, April 25, 2013</div></div>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="US:_Muslim-Born_environmental_lawyer_and_former_academic_to_be_Ordained_as_Rabbi">US: Muslim-Born environmental lawyer and former academic to be Ordained as Rabbi</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">On August 25 in New York City, environmental lawyer and former academic Dario Hunter will become the first Muslim-born man to be ordained as a rabbi. Hunter, an openly gay man raised by an Iranian Muslim father and an African-American mother, will graduate alongside classmates who include a Catholic-born Brazilian and a British songwriter. But so far, none of the graduating class has ever met in person: they've all studied via an online program led by Rabbi Steven Blane of the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute (JSLI). 
<p>A year ago Hunter left behind his academic career in the US and moved to Israel, where he decided to study toward rabbinical ordination. Now, he wakes at 3am Israeli time every Monday to meet Rabbi Blane and his classmates online. 
</p><p>One-third of the members of Hunter's graduating class are converts to Judaism, and their diversity of backgrounds reflects Rabbi Blane's belief in the need to train rabbis to serve the nearly 50% of Jews who are unaffiliated or in interfaith marriages. Blane himself left his previous rabbinical position because he felt he needed to pursue a more progressive mission, and he resigned from the highly regarded Cantors Assembly in 2009 when he was threatened with expulsion for officiating at interfaith weddings. He now trains rabbis and runs an online synagogue, Sim Shalom, which holds services for a global congregation every week. 
</p>
Blane knows that a former Muslim becoming a rabbi will be uncomfortable for some, but the plurality of backgrounds of his graduating class fits perfectly with his belief in Jewish Universalism.<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.businessrevieweurope.eu/press_releases/muslim-born-lawyer-to-be-ordained-as-rabbi">Muslim-Born Lawyer to be Ordained as Rabbi</a><br>Business Review Europe, July 3, 2012</div></div>
