<p><a href="wiki/Harun_Yahya.html" title="Harun Yahya">Harun Yahya</a> has used the recent scientific hypothesis of clay particles as catalysts for abiogenesis as evidence of the veracity of the Qur'an.
</p>
<div class="quotes">In the Qur'an, Allah reveals that the creation of the human is a miracle. The first human being was created by Allah shaping clay into human form and breathing a soul into it:
<dl><dd><b>Your Lord said to the angels, &quot;I am going to create a human being out of clay. When I have formed him and breathed My Spirit into him, fall down in prostration to him!&quot; (Qur'an, 38:71-72)</b></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Then inquire of them: Is it they who are stronger in structure or other things We have created? We created them from sticky clay. (Qur'an, 37:11)</b></dd></dl>
<p>When the human body is examined today, it may be discovered that many elements present on the earth are also to be found in the body. Living tissues contain 95% carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur, with a total of 26 different elements. In another verse of the Qur'an we are told:
</p>
<dl><dd><b>We created man from an extract of clay. (Qur'an, 23:12)</b></dd></dl>
The Arabic word &quot;<i>sulala</i>,&quot; translated as &quot;extract&quot; in the verse, means &quot;representative example, <i>essence</i>.&quot; As we have seen, the information revealed in the Qur'an 1,400 years ago confirms what modern science tells us-the fact that the same elements are employed in human creation as those found in the soil<br> <div class="quotes_ref"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_59.html">Creation from Clay</a><br>Harun Yahya, The Scientific Miracles of the Qur'an</div></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Scientific_Hypothesis">The Scientific Hypothesis</span></h3>
<div class="quotes">Two of the crucial components for the origin of life - genetic material and cell membranes - could have been introduced to one another by a lump of clay, new experiments have shown. 
<p>The study of montmorillonite clay, by Martin Hanczyc, Shelly Fujikawa and Jack Szostak at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, revealed it can sharply accelerate the formation of membranous fluid-filled sacs. 
</p><p>These vesicles also grow and undergo a simple form of division, giving them the properties of primitive cells. Previous work has shown that the same simple mineral can help assemble the genetic material RNA from simpler chemicals. &quot;Interestingly, the clay also gets internalised in the vesicles,&quot; says Leslie Orgel, an origin of life expert at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in San Diego, California. &quot;So this work is quite nice in that it finds a connection between the mechanism that creates RNA and encloses it in a membrane.&quot; 
</p><p>Inherit, mutate, evolve 
</p><p>The genesis of genetic material and the emergence of cell structure are hot areas of research, but until now the two had not connected. The birth of genetic material was clearly crucial for life to take on its unique abilities to inherit, mutate and evolve. 
</p><p>And membranes were key to the physiology of cells because they protect their contents, concentrate chemicals to promote reactions and isolate successful genes from unsuccessful ones. &quot;It's clear you really need both these elements to get evolution off the ground and running,&quot; says Szostak. 
</p><p>Research has already shown that some of building blocks for RNA-like molecules and membranes are spontaneously created by chemical reactions in outer space and in conditions that may have existed on the primordial Earth. But how these subunits were then assembled is still debated. 
</p><p>For RNA, one popular theory revolves around the unusual properties of montmorillonite clay. The negatively charged layers of its crystals create a sandwich of positive charge between them. This turns out to be a highly attractive environment for RNA subunits to concentrate and join together into long chains. 
</p><p>100-fold acceleration 
</p><p>Szostak wondered whether montmorillonite could also help the assembly of vesicles from simple fatty acid precursors. He remembers the day his colleagues Hanczyc and Fujikawa ran into his office to show him their first results: the clay caused a 100-fold acceleration of vesicle formation. 
</p><p>&quot;It was pretty amazing,&quot; he says. Once formed, the vesicles often incorporated bit of clay and were able to grow by absorbing more fatty acid subunits. 
</p><p>His team also showed the clay could hold RNA and form vesicles at the same time. Fluorescently-labelled RNA attached to the clay ended up assembled into vesicles after the reaction. And the researchers were able to get these &quot;protocells&quot; to divide by forcing them through small holes. This caused them to split into smaller vesicles, with minimal loss of their contents. 
</p><p>Szostak admits that in a natural setting the vesicles would rarely be forced to divide in this way. So now his group is searching for different mixtures of membrane-forming molecules that might divide spontaneously when they reach a certain size.

<p>The scientific hypothesis postulates that the clay merely 'match-makes' RNA and membrane vesicles - and therefore does not form a building block. This is contrary to the Islamic faith which postulates that human beings were created <i>from</i> clay, implying clay was a building block. 
</p><p>Notwithstanding this key distinction, is Islam the only religion which postulated the creation of human beings from clay?

-She is the mother goddess and was responsible for the creation of man with the help of Enlil or Enki. She is also called the womb goddess, and midwife of the gods. On Ea's advice, she acted on his direction and mixed clay with the blood of the god Geshtu-e, in order to shape and birth seven men and seven women. These people would bear the workload of the Igigi. She also added to the creation of Gilgamesh, and, at Anu's command, made Enkidu in Anu's image by pinching off a piece of clay, throwing it into the wilderness, and birthing him there.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sumerian">Sumerian</span></h4>
<div class="quotes">According to Samuel Noah Kramer (Tablets of Sumer, Colorado,1956) Nammu and Ninmah, assisted by deities who are the 'good and princely fashioners', mixed clay which was 'over the abyss' and brought man into existence. 
<p>Gods were having difficulty in finding food, and their problems have increased when the later born goddesses joined them. Enki the water god - he was the god of wisdom and in a position to help them - was fast asleep in the sea and did not hear their complaints. Enki's mother Mother of all Gods Nammu brought the tears of the complainants to Enki and told him in their presence: &quot;O! my son, get off your bed... do what is wise. Give shape to (make some) servants to gods. Let them make their own copies.(?)&quot; Enki thinks, decides to head the 'union of good and bright modelists' and says to Nammu: 'O! mother, the creature you have mentioned exists: Put the image of gods(?) on him. Shape his heart from the clay on the surface of the Bottomless Deep. Good and bright modelists will thicken this clay. You make its organs; Ninmah (Goddess of Earth) will work in front of you. While you are making a model…goddesses of birth will be with you. O! mother decide on the faith of the newborn, let Ninmah put the image of gods on it: This is the human.&quot; 
</p><p>&quot;Enki and Ninmah&quot; 
</p>
She is the mother goddess and, as Ninmah, assists in the creation of man. Enki, having been propted by Nammu to create servants for the gods, describes how Nammu and Ninmah will help fashion man from clay. Prior to getting to work, she and Enki drink overmuch at a feast. She then shapes six flawed versions of man from the heart of the clay over the Abzu, with Enki declaring their fates. Enki, in turn also creates a flawed man which is unable to eat. Ninmah appears to curse him for the failed effort.

<div class="quotes">…the Eskimo of Point Barrow, in Alaska, tell of a time when there was no man in the land, till a certain spirit named á sê lu, who resided at Point Barrow, made a clay man, set him up on the shore to dry, breathed into him, and gave him life. Other Eskimo of Alaska relate how the Raven made the first woman out of clay, to be a companion to the first man ; he fastened water-grass to the back of the head to be hair, flapped his wings over the clay figure, and it arose, a beautiful young woman. The Acagchemem Indians of California said that a powerful being called Chinigchinich created man out of clay which he found on the banks of a lake ; male and female created he them, and the Indians of the present day are the descendants of the clay man and woman.
<p>The Maidu Indians of California the first man and woman were created by a mysterious personage named Earth-Initiate, who descended from the sky by a rope made of feathers. His body shone like the sun, but his face was hidden and never seen. One afternoon he took dark red earth, mixed it with water, and fashioned two figures, one of them a man and the other a woman. 
</p><p>The Diegueño Indians or, as they call themselves, the Kawakipais, who occupy the extreme south-western corner of the State of California, have a myth to explain how the world in its present form and the human race were created…. Tcaipakomat took a lump of light-colored clay, split it partly up, and made a man of it. 
</p><p>The Hopi or Moqui Indians of Arizon… Thereupon the eastern goddess took clay and moulded out of it first a woman and afterwards a man ; and the clay man and woman were brought to life just as the birds and beasts had been so before them. 
</p><p>The Pima Indians, another tribe of Arizona, allege that the Creator took clay into his hands, and mixing it with the sweat of his own body, kneaded the whole into a lump. Then he blew upon the lump till it began to live and move and became a man and a woman. A priest of the Natchez Indians in Louisiana told Du Pratz &quot; that God had kneaded some clay, such as that which potters use, and had made it into a little man ; and that after examining it, and finding it well formed, he blew upon his work, and forthwith that little man had life, grew, acted, walked, and found himself a man perfectly well shaped.&quot; 
</p><p>The Michoacans of Mexico said that the great god Tucapacha first made man and woman out of clay. 
</p>
The Lengua Indians of Paraguay believe that the Creator, in the shape of a beetle, inhabited a hole in the earth, and that he formed man and woman out of the clay which he threw up from his subterranean abode.<sup id="cite_ref-James_George_Frazer_9-4" class="reference"><a href="wiki/Creation_of_Humans_from_Clay.html#cite_note-James_George_Frazer-9">[9]</a></sup><br> </div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>This is not a &quot;scientific miracle of the Qur'an&quot; because it is apparent that folkloric tales about the creation of humans from clay/earth/mud is very common throughout the world, and many of these tales pre-date the existence of Islam. 
</p><p>It is also scientifically inaccurate because the Islamic faith claims that human beings were created <i>from</i> clay, contrary to the scientific hypothesis that clay merely 'match-makes' RNA and membrane vesicles - and therefore does not form a building block.
