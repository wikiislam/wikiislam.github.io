In fact we must regard the Sunnah as the only valid explanation of the Qur'anic teachings and the only means to avoid dissensions concerning their interpretation and adaptation to practical use. The Messenger of Allah said 'I am leaving you two things amongst you after my death... the one is the Qur'an and the other is my sunnah or Hadith.' Following hadith therefore is as important as following the injunctions of Qur'an, without which the religion of Islam would be incomplete and would create dissensions among the believers.<br> <div class='quotes_ref'>Sunan Nasa'i, translated by Muhammad Iqbal Siddiqi</div></div>
<div class='quotes'>Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Haakim reported with a saheeh isnaad from al-Miqdaam that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch, narrating a hadeeth from me, and he will say, ‘Between us and you is the Book of Allaah: what it says is halaal, we take as halaal, and what it says is haraam, we take as haraam.’ But listen! Whatever the Messenger of Allaah forbids is like what Allaah forbids.” (Al-Fath al-Kabeer, 3/438. Al-Tirmidhi reported it with different wording, and said that it is hasan saheeh.
