Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).

These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is profitless, and they have lost true direction,

Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness. So they could not see.
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="2:18"> <sup>18</sup></span>
Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).

Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are in terror of death. But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="2:20"> <sup>20</sup></span>
The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps) them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing; for Allah hath power over all things.

Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth).

But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow.

Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: &quot;What means Allah by this similitude?&quot; By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-

How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return.

He said: &quot;O Adam! Tell them their names.&quot; When he had told them, Allah said: &quot;Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?&quot;
</p><p><span style="color:#151B8D;" id="2:34"> <sup>34</sup></span>
And behold, We said to the angels: &quot;Bow down to Adam&quot; and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.

We said: &quot;O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.&quot;

Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: &quot;Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.&quot;

Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.

And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails, saying: &quot;Eat of the good things We have provided for you:&quot; (But they rebelled); to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.

He said: &quot;He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish.&quot; They said: &quot;Now hast thou brought the truth.&quot; Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.
