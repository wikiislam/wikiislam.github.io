<p>From the Moroccan online paper <i>Oujda</i>, comes this article by Muhammad Sharki about the Qur'an's decrees relative to the Jews. Mr. Sharki makes it clear that the Jews should not be known as a &quot;nationality or race,&quot; but rather a &quot;people who embody wickedness, which has brought God's eternal curse upon them.&quot; This curse, described in the Qur'an, came about because of their &quot;disobedience, hostility, abomination, and loyalty to the infidels.&quot; Mr. Sharki then explains that, &quot;A Muslim is not entitled to suppose that Jews are different than how they are described in the Qur'an.&quot;
</p>
<div class="quotes">It is well-known that the Noble Qur'an is the source from which Muslims derive their truths and positions. The Noble Qur'an has spoken on things which still have yet to occur, such as the day of judgment with its subsequent paradise and hell. On the other hand, it has also spoken of things which have already occurred, and other things extending to the present and future, for it is a book of guidance, and not just a history book which records events for the mere sake of recording them. If Muslims take anything from the Noble Qur'an related to their lives and their preparation for death and the next life... There will be no innovation [bid'a; Islamic term denoting apostasy or heresy] in their position towards Jews, for this has been precisely defined by the Noble Qur'an. <b>There is no justification for adopting positions from any source other than the Noble Qur'an</b>. The world today is ruled by the Zionist lobby; the United States, Western Europe, and the rest of the world sympathize with the Jews, due to what is termed '<b>the Holocaust,' which is a carefully-prepared grievance to be used as a pretext for the creation of the Zionist entity, which has never existed throughout history, at the expense of the right of the Palestinian people. It is well-known that the contrived Jewish grievance has caused the world to overlook the crimes of the Zionist entity, which are unprecedented in the history of mankind.</b> The Jews have established a tradition of criminalizing whoever denies their pretended grievance, and have classified this denial as the most serious and ugliest charge ever known in human history. This is termed 'antisemitism,' which they consider akin to hatred of God Himself.
<p>Certainly the opinion of the Jews that antisemitism is the worst taboo in the world today is not correct. If it is not correct in countries tampered with by the Zionist lobby, then it will definitely not be correct in countries who derive their truths and positions from the divine source, and who know <b>the true definition of 'Jew'--not as a nationality or race, as they like to describe themselves to justify their quasi-grievance, but as a people who embody wickedness, which has brought God's eternal curse upon them</b>.
</p><p>The Almighty said in the Noble Qur'an: &quot;Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and (habitually) transgressed. They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did. How wretched was that which they were doing. You see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved. How wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that Allah has become angry with them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally. And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and in what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as allies; but many of them are defiantly disobedient&quot; [Qur'an 5.78-81]. <b>The curse of God has come upon the Jews by the tongue of His prophets (peace be upon them)--not for their race, nationality, or semitism, as they claim, but rather for their disobedience, hostility, abomination, and loyalty to the infidels</b>. If the cursing of David and Jesus did not catch up with them, then the cursing of all the prophets, and last of all of our lord Muhammad (PBUH), will. For this reason, <b>they spared no effort in attempting to kill, poison, and disparage Muhammad through various means.</b> Due to their disobedience, hostility, abomination, and loyalty to the infidels, the Noble Qur'an has defined the position of Muslims toward them, as the Most High said: &quot;<b>You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers (to be) the Jews and those who associate others with Allah&quot; [Qur'an 5.82]</b>. The Noble Qur'an has declared that the hostility between Jews and Muslims is deep-seated, for the Jews are even ahead of the polytheists in the intensity of their hostility against the Muslims.
</p><p>The Prophet (PBUH) emphasized this hostility when he said, <b>&quot;A Jew has never passed by a Muslim without wanting to kill him&quot;</b> [narrated by Abu-Huraira]. This confirms the idea that <b>killing Muslims is a part of the Jews' disobedience, hostility, abomination, and loyalty to the infidels</b>. This is also one of the things which has caused them to receive the cursing of Almighty God, by the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon them. <b>A Muslim is not entitled to suppose that Jews are different than how they are described in the Qur'an--otherwise, he is contradicting the Noble Qur'an</b>. The Qur'an does not stop there, but commands Muslims to refrain from alliance with the Jews, as the Most High said: &quot;<b>O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are (in fact) allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is (one) of them</b>. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people. So you see those in whose hearts is disease hastening into (association with) them, saying, 'We are afraid a misfortune may strike us.' But perhaps Allah will bring conquest or a decision from Him, and they will become, over what they have been concealing within themselves, regretful&quot; [Qur'an 5.51-52]. <b>The Noble Qur'an has stipulated that there should be no alliance between the Muslims and the Jews and Christians</b>, due to the wickedness of the Jews and Christians, wherein they unite against the Muslims.
</p><p>The Noble Qur'an has described any Muslim who attempts to forge an alliance with them as sick in his heart, which is [defined as] hypocrisy in the Noble Qur'an. Those who hedge their bets on an alliance with the Jews and Christians hope they will be able to use crises or misfortunes [as excuses] to justify this alliance which is forbidden in Islam. Almighty God has guaranteed that he will put a stop to these excuses, promising that those who employ them will regret it. If we refer to these Qur'anic texts, which are truths to which no falsehood can approach from before or behind, regarding the reality of the Jews, we find that this reality is identical to the Qur'anic truth. <b>The most intense in hostility in this world towards those who believe are the Jews</b>. They are allied with the Christians, who participate with them in the oppression of Muslims in every corner of the world. They likewise possess sick hearts, and are those who rush to establish relations with the Jews, and grovel before them in order to pacify them, out of fear [that otherwise] misfortunes will befall them. God has made them taste remorse, for their alliance with the Jews and Christians has not profited them anything, but instead has brought the very afflictions which pushed them towards allying with the oppressive Jews and Christians, which alliance was prohibited by the Qur'an. Despite the clarity of Qur'anic scriptures [on the topic], a faction [of Muslims] continues to be sick of heart, taking positions in regard to the Jews which are different than the position that Almighty God has defined in the Noble Qur'an. Some of those who are sick of heart make a distinction between the Jews, making alliances with some of them while hating the others, even though [all] the Jews read [only] one Talmud, and have [only] one ancient covenant.
</p><p>[...] The Noble Qur'an explains that the Jews [often] trade roles with each other, as is the case in the saying of the Most High: &quot;Is it not (true) that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away?&quot; [Qur'an 2.100]. We see this truth today, where a part of the Jews makes treaties and the other part nullifies them. Even the so-called peace supporters among them [only] make a show of peace, but in reality they are hawks in the form of doves...
